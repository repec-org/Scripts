<h2>1: Introduction</h2> 
<p>This document describes version 1 of the Research Documents
Information Format (ReDIF). ReDIF version 1 will be referred to as
ReDIF throughout. ReDIF is a metadata format to describe the output
aspects of academic disciplines. But that we mean the scientific
documents that are produced, the channels through which they are made
public, the authors who produce the documents and the editors who
control the output channels, etc as well as the institutions that
support this process.  ReDIF does not aim at a very elaborate description
of these items. Its overriding design goal is simplicity. It is aimed
primarily for the use by academics as a self-documentation tool. The
idea is that if academics can make a better documentation of their
work themselves, then the need for expensive intermediation between
academics is reduced.  ReDIF is supposed to be understood and deployed
by people with no formal cataloging training.
<p>ReDIF is shipped with software--written in Perl--that allows
to read and validate ReDIF data.  This software is available at
<a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-Perl">http://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-Perl</a>.
For example, any date has to be of the form <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em>. <code>1999-07</code> is
a valid date, whereas <code>Juillet 1999</code> is not a valid date. Therefore ReDIF
is well suited for the decentralized maintenance of metadata. The
validating software will make sure that only data that are
syntactically correct will be passed on to user services.  When subsequent
versions will extend the capabilities of version 1 the data of version 1
will still be able to be understood by processing software that will
implement future versions.
<p>ReDIF is a <em>relational</em> metadata format. Each record has an identifier,
also called a "handle". Elements in one record may use the identifier of
another record. This allows elements to refer to other elements. A simple
example should be sufficient. An author may have written several
papers. She would like to have her email available within the data for each
paper. But if the email address changes, there are changes required to all
the records for all papers that the author has written. That is
cumbersome. Instead, it is better to group all the personal data into one
record, and use the handle of that record whenever personal data is
required. The email address then only needs to be changed at one
place. ReDIF explicitly allows for that.
<p>In order to implement this handle structure, some human effort is
required. This effort is being carried out by a group of people that we
refer to as the "authority" in the
following. <a href="http://www.repec.org">RePEc</a> is a well-know authority that
uses ReDIF.

<h2>2: The ReDIF templates</h2>
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>2.1: The template types</h3><a name="sec:temt"></a>
<p>ReDIF allows to describe things in the world that are important to the work
of an academic discipline. We will use the word "items" to refer to any
such things. ReDIF allows to catalogue three classes of items.  First there
are <em>resources</em>. A resource is either a digital string of information or
anything that can be digitized. A book for example may not be digital but
can be digitized, and therefore it is a resource.  A second group of items
are <em>tangibles</em>. These are objects of descriptions that can not be
digitized. A person for example falls into that category.  Finally, there
are collections. These are manifolds that have a mixed nature that makes it
difficult to decide whether they are tangibles or resources. In the
following table, we list the items, the version of the ReDIF template that
describes it, a description of the item, and finally the class of item.

<h3>2.2: The ReDIF syntax</h3>
<p>ReDIF splits all the information concerning an item into a set of data
elements. By data element we mean an elementary piece of information
that we do not wish to split further. The whole set of data elements
that describe an item forms the bibliographic record or "template"
of this item. "Attribute" and "field" are two synonyms for a data
element. 
<p>The ReDIF templates aim to compromise between human and machine
readability. The general syntax for a field is
<p><em>data_element_name</em><code>:  </code><em>data element value</em>
<p>where <em>data_element_name</em> would for example be
<code>Author-Workplace-Phone</code> and the data element value would be <code>+44
(0)1483 876958</code>.  Of course we could split the telephone number into an
international dialing code, a city code and a local code, but that would
go beyond what our data is actually needed for.  The field name must be
separated from the field value by a colon and optional whitespace. By a
whitespace we mean a space character or a tabulation character or any
combination of those.
<p>Field names may contain only alphanumeric characters, the hyphen <code>-</code> and
the hash sign <code>#</code>. No embedded spaces are allowed. Field names are case
insensitive.  Any field that starts with
<code>X-</code> is considered to be local. The parsing software will read it
but make no checks on the values. 
<p>Any field value may be continued (or even started) on the next line by
adding a whitespace at the beginning of the continuing line. Multi-line
field values are delimited by the first line which does not have a
whitespace character in the first position, or is blank. Thus all lines
containing field names should have no whitespace characters in the
beginning of the line.
<p>The default character set for field values is ISO-8859-1. This is close to
what is called Latin-1 on most machines and close enough to the standard
Microsoft Windows character set. It is also the character set that is used
in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http).
<p>Many fields may be repeated within one record, 
but repetitions are discouraged and for some fields they are
prohibited. But for example, here is a person who works in two places
<pre>
Author-Name: Sturm, J.F.
Author-Workplace-Name: Erasmus University Rotterdam,
       Econometric Institute 
Author-Workplace-Name: Center for Economic Policy Research
</pre>

<p><a name="l6"></a>
<h3>2.3: Order of fields in the template</h3>
<p>The general principle is that all fields may appear in any order within the
template. However there are two important exceptions to this rule.
<p>First, every ReDIF templates must start with the Template-type: field.
The value of this field indicates what type of resource will be described
by this template. Therefore, the set of expected fields in the template
itself depends on that value.  The values for the template type are given in
<a href="redif_1.html#sec:temt">Subsection <a href="redif_1.html#sec:temt">2.1</a></a>. The version number must be quoted
after the template type. The version number will make it easier to
implement changes to ReDIF.  At the moment all template types are in
version 1.0. For an example <pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Archive 1.0
</pre>

<p>Any data that does not start with a correct Template-Type:
declaration will be ignored.
<p>The second restriction of the freedom to group fields is necessary to
express that certain pieces of information have to be kept together.
Consider the case of a paper that has been co-authored by several people.
<p><pre>
Author-Name:  Smith, Adam
Author-Name: Ricardo, David
Author-Email: Ricardo@classical.econ.org
Author-Email: Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org
Author-Workplace-Name: Institute of Classical Economics
</pre>

<p>Looking at this data you can easily find out that Smith's email address is
<code>Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org</code> and that he probably works for the
Institute of Classical Economics as Ricardo does. But computer is not able
to find that out.  We have to order the fields in such a way that the
computer can understand which email address corresponds to which
person. For each person, the name and the email address have to be kept
together.  There are other instances where we have to keep some fields in a
group.  We call such a group of fields a cluster.
<p><a name="l7"></a>
<h2>3: Clusters</h2> <a name="clusters"></a>
<p>A cluster of fields is a group of fields within a template that belong
together.  Clusters are in fact like small templates within templates.  For
example, if we have a template of type "ReDIF-Paper 1.0" that describes a
paper with several authors. It would contain several person clusters, one
cluster for each author. If a document is available online, there should be
one or several clusters with information about the files of the
document--the main body of the text, a dataset that is used
etc--as available on the Internet.
<p>Each type of clusters has it's own field structure. Like templates,
clusters must always start with one particular field, called the "key"
field. Each cluster type has it's own key field.  You should always keep
one cluster's fields together.
<p>Here is a simple cluster of type "Person" which describes an 
author<pre>
Author-Name: Smith, Joe
Author-Email: JoeSmith@some.uni.edu
Author-Postal: PO Box 123, Smith Street, Somewhere In The,
  Universe, 987654 
Author-Phone: +99 456-321123
Author-Homepage: http://www.some.where.edu/~JoeSmith
</pre>

<p>Here is a cluster of type "Organization" describing a provider of a
series of papers: <pre>
Provider-Name: Central Publishing House
Provider-Phone: +44-(0)207 226 7063 
Provider-Homepage: http://www.central-publish.net
</pre>

<p>Clusters can be nested. For example, you can put an organization
cluster to describe the organization an author is affiliated with,
within the cluster of this particular author. Here we have an author
who works at two institutions<pre>
Author-Name: Maria Saguvosky
Author-Workplace-Name: The New York Institute of Blasphemy 
Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://www.new-york.blasphemy.org
Author-Workplace-Name: The New Jersey Institute for Blasphemic Research
</pre>
 
<p>Within this document, when we want to show you that you can use some
cluster type a template, we will use a syntax like
Author-(PERSON*), Provider-(ORGANIZATION*), File-(FILE*)
etc.  Thus the clusters below in this document often join a field
prefix, e.g. "Author-", with a cluster type name, e.g. "(PERSON*)",
between parenthesis.
<p>When writing clusters you should always remember to 
put the key field first. For example,
if you write 
<pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Paper 1.0
Title: The Capital
Author-Email: K.Marx@highgate.london.uk
Author-Name: Marx, Karl 
Author-Phone: ...
</pre>

the Author-Email: field is not recognized, because at that
point the Author-(PERSON*) cluster has not yet started.  This will
result in an error message or in your template being ignored.  But the
Author-Name: field that follows will start the cluster, because
"Name" is the key field of the (PERSON*) cluster. Hence
the Author-Phone: field will be correctly processed.
<p>This is all you need to know about clusters in general. We now address
the specifics of the different cluster types.
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<h3>3.1: The ORGANIZATION*  cluster</h3>
<p>The <strong>ORGANIZATION*</strong> cluster is defined by the following fields:<br>
<p><center><table width=100% border=0> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Name </td> 

<td align=left> Name of organization, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td>

<td align=left> English translation of the name of organization <br></td>

<td align=left> Postal </td> 

<td align=left> Postal Address of organization <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Location </td> 

<td align=left> Name of place where organization is based, e.g. "Harare" <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Email </td> 

<td align=left> Electronic mail address(es) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Phone </td> 

<td align=left> Telephone number(s) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Fax </td> 

<td align=left> Fax number(s) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Institution </td> 

<td align=left> Handle of an institution template that describes the organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

</table></center>
<p><strong>Name</strong> is the key field of the organization cluster. It should
always be put first. Otherwise the most useful item is the
homepage. Much of the remaining information can be derived from
the homepage. It should be supplied if the homepage information
is missing or the data at the homepage is not specific enough. 
<p>Here is an example of the organization cluster
use to describe the provider of a working paper series. 
<pre>
Provider-Name:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Provider-Homepage: http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/ 
Provider-Email: fedspapers@frb.gov 
</pre>

<p>If a ReDIF institution template is available, then a better way to
write to describe this institution is
<pre>
Provider-Name:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Provider-Institution: RePEc:edi:frbgvus
</pre>

<p>In that case, the data of the institution template is used to describe
the institution. It is then no longer necessary to give any further
details about the institution within the template. The advantage of
this representation is that when there is a change in the data for the
institution, it is no longer necessary to update the data for the
institution within each (ORGANIZATION*) cluster within each (PERSON*)
cluster of every author who has written a paper when affiliated with
that institution.
<p><a name="l9"></a>
<h3>3.2: The Person cluster</h3>
<p>The <strong>PERSON</strong> cluster is used to describe a person. It
has the following fields<br>
<p><center><table width=100% border=0> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td>

<td align=left> Name of person, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Homepage </td> 

<td align=left> URL of person's home page <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Workplace-(ORGANIZATION*) </td> 

<td align=left> Organization in which person works <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Email </td> 

<td align=left> Electronic mail address(es) of person <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Fax </td> 

<td align=left> Fax number(s) of person <br></td>

<td align=left> Postal </td> 

<td align=left> Postal address of person <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Phone </td> 

<td align=left> Telephone contact information <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Person </td> 

<td align=left> Handle of a person template that describes the person <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

</table></center>
<p><strong>Name</strong> is the key field of the person cluster. It should
always be put first. 
<p>If a ReDIF person template for a person is available, then there is
easy way to describe a person.  This is done through the person
template. For example
<p><pre>
Author-Name: Thomas Krichel
Author-Person: RePEc:per:1965-06-05:thomas_krichel
</pre>

<p>Now all the information about the person, including the
workplace data, is read from the person handle.  No further
information about the person needs to be entered. 
<p><a name="l10"></a>
<h3>3.3: The FILE cluster</h3><a name="filecluster"></a>
<p>The (FILE*) cluster is used to describe a file that contains
the resource that is being described, or a part of it.<br>
<p><center><table width=100% border=0> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> URL </td> 

<td align=left> Uniform Resource Locator of file, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td>

<tr> 

<td align=left> Format </td> 

<td align=left> The format, e.g. "application/pdf" for PDF files <br></td>

<td align=left> The file size, by default in kilobytes <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> Restriction </td> 

<td align=left> A restriction placed on accessing the file <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

</table></center>
<p>These fields of the (FILE*) cluster are not as the fields of the
previous clusters.  We describe each of them in more detail.
<p><strong>URL</strong>: This is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the file on the
Internet. The URL identifies an access protocol and a code that this
protocol can use to retrieve the resource. Please refer to
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1738.txt">
RFC1783</a> when composing a URL. 
Any whitespace in
the URL will be ignored. Following RFC1783 any whitespace that follows
a dash character "-" is considered to be a mistake, because it is
likely to have been introduced by word processing software. The 
URL can be written over several lines, but do not break it after a
dash. <pre>
File-URL:
  http://www.hhs.se/research/wpecofi/papers/wp0121.pdf.zip 
File-URL: ftp://crefe.dse.uqam.ca/pub/cahiers/cah44.ps
</pre>

<p>This is the key field of the file cluster. It should
always be put first. 
<p><strong>Format</strong>: This is a an optional field to give a precise indication
about the type of format that is found in the field. 
The field Format: is not repeatable and is case-insensitive.
The contents of this field (all valid values) is
restricted by a controlled vocabulary, the MIME Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions types.  These types are specified in the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1521.txt">
RFC1521</a>.  The <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">complete and
up-to-date list</a> of these types is maintained by the IANA.
We do not support any values for file format that are not listed
there. If you want to convey information about a type
that is not registered here, please contact the IANA. 
The most important MIME types that are used by the
ReDIF collections are <code>application/pdf</code> and <code>application/postscript</code>, as
well <code>text/html</code>. If you simply
want to give a message to the user about the file, it is best to
use the Function: field.
<p><strong>Function</strong>: This is the function of the file. It should be used when a file 
represents only some part of the whole resource. The field
value may indicate what particular part of the document is represented
by the file.
Here are three examples
<pre>
File-Function: Appendix 1
</pre>

<pre>
File-Function: Main text
</pre>
 
<pre>
File-Function: Fortran program used for the simulations
 reported in the paper 
</pre>

If the file is a complete rendering of the resource, the <code>File-Function</code>
field should not be used at all.  When we have different files with
no file function, user services should assume that all are alternative
renderings of the complete text. 
<p><strong>Size</strong>: The file size, by default in kilobytes. 
This is an optional and obsolete field. It is not repeatable. Examples
<pre>
File-Size: 48
...
File-Size: 1788984 bytes
</pre>

<p>
<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a file. If the file
can be retrieved by anybody with Internet access without any
preliminary payment or registration, you should <strong>not</strong> use that field
at all. As soon as there is a restriction on the file many services
will be assuming that there is no public access to the file.  Some
user services may wish to display only non-restricted files and your
file will not appear there. If all files of a document are restricted,
please use the field Restriction: in the template of the resource,
rather than repeating it for each file of the resource.
<p>

<h2>4: The Collection templates</h2><a name="sitetemplates"></a>
<p>The collection templates describe archives and series. We list
the fields for these templates by order of importance, the
most important is put first. 
<p><a name="l12"></a>
<h3>4.1: The Archive template</h3>
<p><strong>Template-type:</strong> <code>ReDIF-Archive 1.0 </code>
<p>Each archive template must start with this statement.
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the archive handle. The
handle of the archive is the name of the authority (for example
<code>RePEc</code>), a <code>:</code> and then the <em>archive_identifier</em>.  The
archive identifier is proposed by the archive administrator and
awarded by the authority. It should not have semantic contents.
<p><strong>URL</strong>:  This is a mandatory field for the archive directory. 
The URL should either point to a http of ftp site.  should
end with the archive code. 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Email</strong>: This is mandatory field for the email of
somebody in charge of the archive. It is very important to keep it
this field up-to-date. In particular, it is preferable not to use a
personal email address of an employee that may move on later. It is
best to give a general address of the sponsor of the archive. Make
sure that the mail is read there and transmitted to the person who
really maintains the archive.
<p><strong>Name</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the name of the archive.
This is a name that will be shown to users when they access contents
of the archive. 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Name</strong>: 
This is an optional field  for
the name of a person that is in charge of the archive.
<p><strong>Maintainer-Phone</strong>: This is an optional field  for the
phone number of a person
in charge of the archive.
<p><strong>Maintainer-Fax</strong>: This is an optional field for the fax number of a
person in charge of the archive.
<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: 
This is an optional field  for
subject information for the archive.
Consult the same field in the Paper template and
Appendix A for description.
<p><strong>Homepage</strong>: This is optional field
for the URL of the archive's homepage. This should 
point to a location that an end user may be interested in. 
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is an optional field  for
a description of the archive's contents.
<p><strong>Notification</strong>: This is an optional field that may
be used to specify how new papers in the archive are
announced.
<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: This is an optional field to specify access
restriction. It should be handle with care. A restriction mentioned
here applies to all files referred to in all resources of all series in
the archive.  If the series can be retrieved by anybody with internet
access, you should not use that field at all. If not all of the series
that make up the archive are restricted, mention the restriction only
in the series templates of the restricted series.
<p>Here we have two examples for the archive templates
<pre>

<h3>4.2: The Series template</h3>
<p><strong>Template-type</strong>: <code>ReDIF-Series 1.0 </code>
<p>Each series template must start with this statement.
<p><strong>Name</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the name of the series. 
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the handle for the
description of the series as made by the archive. The handle of the
series is the name of the authority, a <code>:</code>, the handle of the
archive, a <code>:</code>, and then the <em>series_identifier</em>.  This field must
not contain whitespace. It should not have semantic contents. The
series code is awarded by the archive or the authority. 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Email</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the email address
of a person who is in charge of the series' files but not necessarily of its
contents.  The maintainer should be ready
receive error reports. As with the archive maintainer's email,
a personal address should be avoided. 
<p><strong>Type</strong>: Each series may only contain one type of templates. This
rule is called "Baum's principle". The Type: field is used to
indicate the type.  The default type is "ReDIF-Paper". If the type
of the elements of the series is "ReDIF-Paper", then this field does
not need to be specified.  Other legal series types are
"ReDIF-Software", "ReDIF-Article", and "ReDIF-Book".
<p><strong>Order-Email</strong>: This is an optional field for the 
email address where to send ordering requests to.
<p><strong>Order-Homepage</strong>: This is an optional
field for the URL of a screen where orders can be placed.
<p><strong>Order-Postal</strong>: Snail mail address where to order the paper.
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Price for all papers in the series when ordered. 
 Can be overwritten by a separate Price: field in the paper
<p><strong>Provider-(ORGANIZATION*)</strong>: This is the organization that supports
the series.
<p><strong>Publisher-(ORGANIZATION*)</strong>: This is a synonym for "provider". It
is valid for historical reasons.
<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of all papers in the
series. It has the same meaning as in File cluster. 
It implies that all the files of all the documents in that
particular series have this restriction. 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Phone</strong>: This is an optional field for the
phone number of the person in charge of the series 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Fax</strong>: This is as optional field for the fax number of some person
 in charge of the series 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Name</strong>: This is an optional field for the name of a
person that is in charge of the files contained in the series.
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This can be a short description of the series'
content. 
<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: This is an optional field for a subject
for the series according to scheme <em>scheme</em>. Consult the same field
in description of the paper template and Appendix A for description.
<p><strong>Keywords</strong><em>[</em><strong>-</strong><em>scheme]</em>: This is an optional field for keywords
for the series according to scheme <em>scheme</em>. Consult the same field
in the Paper template and Appendix A for description.
<p><strong>Editor-(PERSON*)</strong>: This is the person responsible for the contents
of the series. 
<p><strong>Notification</strong>: This is an optional field to say how how new papers in the series are
announced.
<p><strong>ISSN</strong>: This is the International Standard Serial Number for the series,
if available. 
<p>Here are two examples for series templates.

<h3>4.3: The authority template</h3>
<p>This is a draft template.
<p><strong>Template-type:</strong> <code>ReDIF-Mirror 1.0 </code> 
<p>Each authority template must start with this declaration.
<p><strong>Url</strong>: The url where the authority is based. Required
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: The handle of the authority. Required
<p>Example:
<pre>
Template-type: ReDIF-Authority 1.0
Url: http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/RePEc
Handle: RePEc
</pre>

<p><a name="l15"></a>
<h3>4.4: The Mirror template</h3>
<p>The mirror template describes what kind of mirror you are running on
your machine.  This template is obsolete and therefore no
longer included here.

<p><a name="l16"></a>
<h2>5: The Resource template types</h2>
<p><a name="l17"></a>
<h3>5.1: The ReDIF-Paper Template</h3><a name="papertemplate"></a>
<p>This template concerns all papers that are not published as part of a
journal.  We will be a bit more verbose here than in <a href="redif_1.html#othertemplates">Section
<a href="redif_1.html#othertemplates">5.2</a></a> where we describe other templates.
<p>We will list here the elements of the paper template in decreasing
order of importance. We start with those elements that are
really necessary. We then list those element that are optional
but important. Finally, we turn to those elements that
are not important.
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a required field to identify the bibliographic
record.  The Handle: field content starts with the name of the
authority (organization), for example RePEc.  The next element is
 the code of the archive, then follows the code of the series and
 finally the number of the paper within the series. All these parts
 are separated separated by the colon character, i.e. <code>:</code>. Note that
 this field may not contain whitespace. If the <em>Handle</em> is written
 over several lines, the processing software will eliminate the
 whitespace characters on the line boundaries. Use: 
<pre>
Handle: RePEc:bon:bonnsf:a452
</pre>

<p><strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong>: This is a required cluster field to describe the
person(s) who has authored the document, i.e. who is responsible for
its intellectual content. We recommend the name of the author should
be given in normalized format like "Lastname, Firstname" but the
direct order is also acceptable. Please add the full first names if
you know them, but omit titles, honors and others. If there are
several authors, there should be a separate field for each author.
The special author name "et al" should be used when refering to a
list of unknown other names. These other authors should be placed in a
separate author cluster.
<p>The <strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong> field is mandatory.  That means that you
should give at least one Author-Name: field with some value in each
ReDIF-Paper template. Other information about the author is
optional. Please do not overload the templates with author
information. If you want to give elaborate personal information,
register the person with a personal registration service.
Use:<pre>
Author-Name: Lang, William
Author-Email: wlang@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu 
Author-Workplace-Name: Center for Economic Performance 
Author-Name: Sturm, J.F.  
Author-Workplace-Name: Erasmus University Rotterdam,

Author-Workplace-Email: eb-webmaster@few.eur.nl 
Author-Homepage: http://www.eur.nl/few/ei/stu.html 
Author-Name: et al
</pre>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: The title of the paper. This includes any subtitles. This
is a required field. Use: 
<p><pre>
Title: A Theory of Gradual Trade Liberalisation
</pre>

<p><strong>Creation-Date</strong>: The date at which the original document was
created. The format should be as similar to the <em>ISO 8601:1988 Data
elements and interchange formats--Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times</em>  as possible. This is
<em>yyyy</em>[<code>-</code><em>mm</em>[<code>-</code><em>dd</em>]] where <em>yyyy</em> is the year, <em>mm</em>
is the month and <em>dd</em> is the day, and the square brackets
indicate that the element is optional.   Note that the field should only
contain the date of the creation, no other information. This field is
not repeatable. Use: <pre>
Creation-Date: 1995-06-30 
</pre>

or <pre>
Creation-Date: 1996 
</pre>

<p><strong>FILE*</strong>: A file cluster for a component of the paper. If the paper
is contained in only one file, then quote the URL for that file. If
the paper is available in various files, the file cluster should be
repeated. If there are files that do not contain the full text of the
paper, the File-Function: field should be used to specify the
role of the file in the document. Under <em>no circumstances</em> should the
(FILE*) cluster be used to link to an intermediate page where the
files can be retrieved from via further hyperlinks.  Use Order-URL:
for this purpose.
<p><strong>Order-URL</strong>: This is the URL of an intermediate page where there is
ordering information about the file. The term "ordering information"
should be taken in the widest possible sense. For example, web page
with a set of links to various manifestation of the paper is a good
candidate for an Order-URL:.  Note that the URL should be specific to
the paper. If all the papers in the series have the same ordering URLs
then that information should be put in the series template.
<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: This is the classification number
associated with the document. The <strong>scheme</strong> is a code for a
classification scheme.  If there are several classification numbers of
the same classification scheme, they will be separated by a
semicolon. This field is not repeatable, unless there are multiple
schemes used. Allowed (registered) classification schemes and codes
are listed in the Appendix.  If you have documents, classified with
some other scheme, just email us your suggestion, and we will register
your scheme. Use:<pre>
Classification-JEL: C12; C30
</pre>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This is the abstract of the document. Although we do
not require to have an abstract, but we strongly recommend to
provide a detailed abstract, because it increases the chance of users
finding your document within a full-text database. 
If you have a long abstract that has several paragraphs,
you can leave a blank line. Use:
<pre>
Abstract: This is the first paragraph of the abstract.

 This is the second paragraph of the abstract.
</pre>

However, please recall that every line that follows the first line
has to be indented with at least one blank.
<p><strong>Keywords[-</strong><em>scheme</em><strong>]</strong>: These are keywords associated with the
text. If there are several keywords they will be separated by a
semicolon.  <em>Scheme</em> is the keywords scheme's code but it can also
be empty, to say that the keywords do not follow a
scheme. Keywords: should be used in that case.  If you have some
keywords scheme, we will register it for you. Use:
<p><pre>
Keywords: Competition; Consumer economics; Ethics; Philosophy of economics

Keywords: Accounting theory; Accounting principles; Financial accounting
</pre>

<p><strong>Contact-Email</strong>: This field gives a contact email address for the
paper. This does not need to be one of the authors' email address. In
some cases where the author does not wish her email to be in the paper
information or when no author email is available, this field should be used.
Use:<pre>
Contact-Email: Economics_Secretariat@hicks.gross-uni.yy
</pre>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a paper. This is
similar to the field of the same name in the File cluster. If the
paper can be retrieved by anybody with internet access, you should not
use that field at all. Please do not use the field to make
recommendations of the type "please use outside working hours",
since as soon as there is a restriction on a paper many services will
be assuming that there is no public access to it.  If not all of the
files that make up the paper are restricted, mention the restriction
only in the (FILE*) cluster of the restricted.
<p>The following elements are not important. They have been 
introduced to integrate legacy data into ReDIF-based system.
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Any other information that is relevant for the document. This 
can be its relation to other documents, a word or two about the history of 
the document etc. Use: 
<pre>
Note: This was an invited paper to a special issue of the 
 Noddyland Journal of Blasphemy
</pre>

<p><strong>Length</strong>: The length of a printed version of the 
document, usually in pages. This field is not repeatable.
Use: <pre>
Length: 29 pages
</pre>

<p><strong>Series</strong>: This is the series of the document. You can simply name
the series here.
This field is not repeatable.
<p><strong>Number</strong>: The number of the paper within the series. This field
is not repeatable.
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: This field can be used to state if a paper is out of
print. If the paper is on the net it should not be used. It can also
be used to say how the get hold of the copy of the paper.  This
field is not repeatable.  Use: <pre>
Availability: out of print
</pre>

<p><strong>Revision-Date</strong>: A date at which the document was changed.
The format for the value of that field is the same 
as in Creation-Date:. This field may be repeated. 
<pre>
Revision-Date: 1995-06-30
</pre>

<p><strong>Price</strong>: That refers to the price of a printed copy of the document,
when ordered through the ordering channels specified in the 
series template.  Use: 
<pre>
Price: $3.00 Surface, $4.00 Air (U.S. $)
Price: 15 guilders by mail, free by ftp 
</pre>

For the price of an electronic copy, use the Restriction: field.
<p><strong>Publication-Status</strong>: This can be used 
 to say if a modified version of the document exists, has been
forthcoming, etc. in a commercial journal, book or other type of
formal publication. It should always start with the word "published"
or the word "forthcoming" (case insensitive). Use: 
<pre>

Title:  Phases of Imitation and Innovation in a North-South 
  Endogenous Growth  Model
Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a North-South endogenous growth
  model to examine three phases of development in the South: imitation
  of Northern products, imitation and innovation and finally, innovation
  only. In particular, the model has the features of catching up (and
  potentially overtaking) which are of particular relevance to the 
  Pacific Rim economies.  We show that the possible equilibria 
  depend on cross-country assimilation effects and the ease of
  imitation.  We then apply the model to analyze the impact of R&amp;D
  subsidies.  There are some clear global policy implications which
  emerge from our analysis.  Firstly, because subsidies to Southern
  innovation benefit the North as well, it is beneficial to the North
  to pay for some of these subsidies.  Secondly, because the ability
  of the South to assimilate Northern knowledge and innovate depends
  on Southern skills levels, the consequent spillover benefits on 
  growth make the subsidizing of Southern education by the North
  particularly attractive.

<h3>5.2: ReDIF templates for other documents</h3><a name="othertemplates"></a>
<p>In this Subsection, we look at templates that describe other forms of
scientific documents. Most of the fields are the same as in the
ReDIF-Paper template and thus need no further explanation.
<p><a name="l19"></a>
<strong>5.2.1: The ReDIF-Article Template</strong><p>
<p>An article is something that appeared in a journal or is forthcoming
in a journal. This is a draft template for such publications.
<p><strong>Template-Type</strong>: ReDIF-Article 1.0
<p>The template must start with this field
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: Handle of journal article. This is a required field. It is of the 
same form as the handle of the paper template. 
<p>As far as the series identifier is concerned, only series of articles
are admissible here. Note that a journal is a nothing else than a
series of articles. It therefore has a series code like a paper
series. It can be refereed to as a "journal code" in casual
language, but the reader should keep in mind that as far as the
structure of ReDIF is concerned the journal is nothing else than a
series.
<p>The <em>article_code</em> is a concatenation of qualifiers, separated by
the underscore character <code>_</code>. Each qualifier is an
<em>field</em><em>value</em> pair. The <em>field</em> is represented by one letter
only. This is best understood by an example.
<p>RePEc:xxx:joinec:v19_y1985_i2_Q1_p67-84
<p>The qualifiers currently defined are the following. We list a name for
the qualifier, the letter of the qualifier, a description of values
and a perl regular expression that that can be used to verify the
syntax of the qualifier, as well as an optional additional check. All
regular expressions are case insensitive.<br>
<p>Name: volume<br>
Letter: v<br>
Value: any sequence of digits<br>
RegEx: v[1-9][0-9]*<br>
<p>Name: issue<br>
Letter: i<br>
Value: any sequence of digits<br>
RegEx: i[1-9][0-9]*<br>
<p>Name: year<br>
Letter: y<br>
Value: any sequence of four digits<br>
RegEx: y([1-9][0-9]{3})<br>
Check: warn if $1 is higher then current year or earlier than 1500<br>
<p>Name: pages <br>
Value: number of page where article starts - number of page where the 
article ends<br>
RegEx: pS*([1-9][0-9]*)-S*([1-9][0-9]*)<br>
Check: $1 should be smaller than $2<br>
<p>Here the S stands for "supplement", just in case that the 
paper has not been published in the main issue. <br>
<p>Name: issue<br>
Value: which issue within the year. If the issue is a month, then
  we give the English three letter start of the month: JAN, FEB
  MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. The numbers of the
  months are also allowed here, but that is discouraged. If the issue is a
  quarter, we use Q1, Q2 etc. If the issue has a start
  date, put that date like 04-01 for 1 April. Note that you need
  to put the - separator here because the date is otherwise mistaken
  to be the number of the issue.There is no need to put an end date
  for this issue. You can repeat the issue qualifier
  if the physical issue covers several logical issues. SPE can be
  added to say it is a special editions, and S can be 
  postponed for a supplement. <br>
RegEx: i:(($months\d*)($season[S]*)(Q[1234])(\d+)(\d\d-\d\d))
  where <br> $month="(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)"
  and <br>$season="(spr|sum|aut|win|spe)" 
<p>In fact the information thus encoded in the handle can also be encoded
in separate fields. These are listed here.  None of these fields
is repeatable. They are fields that are specific to the article
template, i.e. they do not appear in the paper template.
<p><strong>Journal</strong>: Name of the journal.
<p><strong>Year</strong>: Year of publication of the article.
<p><strong>Pages</strong>: The pages of the article in the journal
in the form <em>start</em><code>-</code><em>end</em>, where <em>start</em> is
the number of the first page and <em>end</em> is the
number of the last page.
<p><strong>Price</strong>: Price of the article if mailed individually.
<p><strong>Volume</strong>: The volume number that the article
appeared in. 
<p><strong>Month</strong>: The month where the journal issue where
the article is appeared in.
<p><em>template</em><strong>-Handle</strong>: where <em>template</em> may take the values
<em>Paper</em>, <em>Book</em> or <em>Chapter</em>. These handles can be quoted if
the paper was published in several places.
<p>Other fields are like the paper template except that the following are
not valid: Length:, Series: Availability:, Revision-Date: and
Article-Handle:.

<p>What happens if you wish to provide data about the formal publication,
i.e., within a journal, of a paper for which you have ReDIF-Paper
information. This is called Sune's problem. The basic status is that
it is not possible for you to provide information about an article
that you have published in a journal. It is for the journal or some
agent of the journal to provide that information, because all the
information about all the articles has to be kept together in once
directory. However, you can give the Article handle, and a ReDIF
literate individual should be able to find the information.

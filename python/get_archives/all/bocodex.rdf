Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: xtivreg2 implements IV/GMM estimation of the fixed-effects and first-differences panel data models
 with possibly endogenous regressors.  It is essentially a wrapper for ivreg2, which must be
 installed for xtivreg2 to run (version 2.1.10 or above of ivreg2 is required: ssc install ivreg2, replace). 
 xtivreg2 supports
 all the estimation and reporting options of ivreg2; see help ivreg2 for full descriptions and
 examples.  In particular, all the statistics available with ivreg2 (heteroskedastic, cluster- and
 autocorrelation-robust covariance matrix and standard errors, overidentification and orthogonality
 tests, first-stage and weak/underidentification statistics, etc.) are also supported by xtivreg2
 and will be reported with any degrees-of-freedom adjustments required for a panel data estimation.
Keywords: instrumental variables, panel data, fixed effects, first differences, Sargan test, robust estimation, orthogonality, GMM, Hansen's J, heteroskedastic OLS,
 HAC, bandwidth, k-class estimator, LIML
Requires: Stata version 8.2
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install xtivreg2". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: OUTREG2: Stata module to arrange regression outputs into an illustrative table
Author-Name: Roy Wada
Author-Email: roywada@hotmail.com
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: outreg2 provides a fast and easy way to produce an illustrative table 
 of regression outputs. The regression outputs are produced piecemeal and are 
 difficult to compare without some type of rearrangement. outreg2 
 automates this process by concatenating the successive regression ouputs in a 
 vertical format. The resulting table is saved to the disk in ASCII 
 format, which can be read by other programs. outreg2 thus facilitates 
 the convertion of regression outputs to a standard format suitable for 
 inclusion in a scholarly publication. The functionality of outreg2 is based on the earlier package outreg, 
 by John Luke Gallup. Unlike outreg, outreg2 is capable of writing LaTeX-format
 tables, as well as ASCII, MS Word and MS Excel.
Keywords: regression, output, tables, tab-delimited output, LaTeX
Requires: Stata version 8.2

 typing "ssc install outreg2". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

 calculated, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is calculated for cases and 
 controls.  Allelic and genotypic models are tested under a number of 
 different disease models, and all results are collated into one Stata 
 formatted data set for subsequent use.  Html formatted tables and graphs of 
 results can be drawn if desired. Roger Newson's listtex package and David
 Clayton's genassoc package (from http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/stata/) 
 are required.

Title: NBSTRAT: Stata module to estimate Negative Binomial with Endogenous Stratification
Author-Name: Joseph Hilbe
Author-Email: jhilbe@aol.com
Author-Name: Roberto Martinez-Espineira
Author-Workplace-Name: St. Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: nbstrat fits a maximum-likelihood negative binomial with endogenous stratification
 regression model of depvar on indepvars, where depvar is a nonnegative count variable > 0. 
 lnalpha is parameterized by the predictors entered within its parentheses.
 gnbstrat simultaneously accommodates three features of on-site samples dealing with count 
 data: overdispersion relative to the Poisson; truncation at zero, and endogenous stratification 
 due to oversampling of frequent users of the site. Endogenous stratification occurs when the 
 likelihood of sampling observations is dependent on a choice made by the subject of study which 
 is in itself the dependent variable. For example, in recreational demand analysis, if an on-site 
 survey is conducted, one is more likely to interview subjects who visit the site more times per 
 week and ask how many times they visit, hence the endogeneity. Also patients who visit the doctor 
 more frequently are also more likely to be sampled if the survey is conducted at the clinic, etc.

Title: IVVIF: Stata module to report variance inflation factors after IV
Author-Name: David Roodman
Author-Email: DRoodman@CGDEV.ORG
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Center for Global Development
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: ivvif extends Stata's official vif/estat vif command, which reports variance inflation factors.
 It differs in two ways. As well as working after  regress, it can run after instrumented regressions done with  ivreg or  ivreg2.
 In this case, it projects regressors onto instruments before computing VIFs.
 In other words, it reports the VIFs for the second stage of two-stage least squares.
 The other difference is that it makes the results available in a return matrix, named "vif", along with vif's return macros, which can ease working with the results in Stata code.
Keywords: variance inflation factor, collinearity, instrumental variables
Requires: Stata version 7.0

Title: IVRESET: Stata module to perform Ramsey/Pesaran-Taylor/Pagan-Hall RESET specification test after IV/GMM/OLS estimation
Author-Name: Mark E. Schaffer
Author-Email: m.e.schaffer@hw.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Heriot-Watt University
Author-Person: psc51
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  ivreset performs various flavors of Ramsey's
 regression error specification test (RESET)
 as adapted by Pesaran and Taylor (1999)
 and Pagan and Hall (1983)
 for instrumental variables (IV) estimation.
 The RESET test is sometimes called an "omitted variables test"
 but probably is best interpreted as
 a test of neglected nonlinearities in the choice of functional form.
 Under the null that there are no neglected nonlinearities,
 the residuals should be uncorrelated with low-order polynomials in y-hat,
 where the y-hats are the "forecast values" of the dependent variable
 that are functions of the instruments (exogenous variables) only.
 The test flavors vary according to the polynomial terms
 (square, cube, 4th power of y-hat),
 the choice of forecast values
 (Pesaran-Taylor optimal forecasts
 or Pagan-Hall reduced form forecasts),
 test statistic (Wald or GMM-distance),
 and large vs. small sample statistic (chi-squared or F-statistic).
 If the original estimation
 was heteroskedastic-robust, cluster-robust,
 autocorrelation-consistent (AC),
 or heteroskedastic and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC),
 the RESET test reported will be as well.
 ivreset can also be used after OLS or HOLS regression
 with regress or ivreg2,
 when there are no endogenous regressors.
 In this case, a standard Ramsey RESET test
 using fitted values of y is reported.
 This is version 1.0.03 of ivreset.

Title: PALETTE_ALL: Stata module to display all the named colours in Stata
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command will display all Stata's named colours in one graph so that you can make a comprehensive choice
 of how to colour your graphs. There is only one option and that is to change the background colour. The idea is that 
 when choosing the colours for your graph you would need to see how they look on the colour of your plotregion.
Keywords: graph, color, colour, color palette
Requires: Stata version 8

Author-Name: Ben Jann
Author-Email: ben.jann@soz.gess.ethz.ch
Author-WorkPlace-Name: ETH Zurich
Author-Person: pja61
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  This package includes various Mata functions. quantile(), median(),
 iqrange() compute quantiles. ecdf() returns the empirical cumulative
 distribution function. relrank() computes relative ranks (grade
 transformation). colrunsum() returns the running sum. insheet() and
 infile() return the contents of an ASCII delimited (spreadsheet)
 file as a string matrix. outsheet() may be used to export a string
 matrix into a delimited (spreadsheet) file. invtokens() is the
 "inverse" of official Mata's tokens(). It returns the elements of a
 string rowvector joined together in a single string where the
 individual elements are separated by blanks. ipolate() returns
 linearly interpolated values. strexpand() expands string arguments.
 makegrid() returns a grid of equally spaced points over the range of
 a data vector. linbin() and exactbin() may be used for linear binning, while
 histogram() produces histogram frequencies.
Keywords: Mata,  quantile, median, inter-quartile range, cumulative distribution, relative ranks, running sum
 linear interpolation, insheet, infile, outsheet, spreadsheet, tokens, rowvector, string, real, grid,

Title: SVYBSAMP2: Stata module to perform re-sampling for complex survey data
Author-Name: R. E. De Hoyos
Author-Email: red29@cam.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Cambridge
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: -svybsamp2- creates a new data set with _N randomly drawn observations 
 (with replacement). As with -svysamp-, the procedure respects survey design, 
 re-sampling within different combinations of strata and PSU. Therefore using the 
 inflation factors (pweights), the new sample can be used to get to the original 
 "super-population".

Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Cambridge
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: -svyselmlog- estimates the parameters of the main equation correcting 
 for selectivity using the conditional probabilities from a multinomial logit. 
 -svyselmlog- allows for three parametric selectivity-correction methods like the 
 ones developed in Lee (1984), Durbin and McFadden (1984) and Bourguignon, Fournier 
 and Gurgand (2004). Additionally, selectivity can be adjusted following Dahl's (2002) 
 semi-parametric method.

Title: MEHETPROB: Stata module to compute marginal effects at means and their standard errors after hetprob 
Author-Name: Thomas Cornelissen
Author-Email: cornelissen@mbox.iqw.uni-hannover.de
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Hannover
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: -mehetprob- computes marginal effects at means and their standard errors 
 after the estimation of a heteroscedastic probit model by -hetprob-. It delivers the 
 same results as -mfx compute- after -hetprob-, but it is faster. While -mfx- computes 
 the derivatives needed to infer the standard errors numerically, -mehetprob- computes 
 them analytically. Thus -mehetprob- takes only a few seconds while -mfx compute- after 
 -hetprob- can take several hours in Stata 8 and several minutes in Stata 9.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: spearman2 performs the same functions as Stata's original spearman with one exception. If a
 varlist of two variables is given, spearman produces a test of the hypothesis of a zero
 rank correlation, and provides a p-value for that test. It does not display the test
 statistic. In contrast, spearman2 calculates and displays the standard error of the
 coefficient, and displays the t-statistic for the test as well as its degrees of freedom.
 These items are returned as r(rhose), r(rhot), r(rhodf) respectively.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo strategy by McLeod and Hipel (Water Resources Research, 1978),
 originally thought for time series data, has been adapted to dynamic panel 
 data models by Kiviet (1995). This procedure is more efficient than the 
 traditional approaches in that it generates start-up values according to the 
 data generation process, so it avoids wasting random numbers in the generation 
 of initial conditions and also small sample non-stationarity problems. 
 This presentation discusses my Stata implementation of Kiviet's 
 (Journal of Econometrics, 1995) procedure, as used in Bruno (2005) and (2004) 
 to evaluate the finite sample properties of theoretical approximations 
 for the LSDV bias (Bruno (Economics Letters 2005; UKSUG 2004)) and of the 
 bias-corrected LSDV estimator (Bruno (2004); Italian SUG 2004) in the 
 presence of unbalanced designs.

Title: FITINT: Stata module to fit generalized linear model and test two-way interactions
Author-Name:  AndrÈ Charlett
Author-Workplace-Name: Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London
Author-Email: andre.charlett@hpa.org.uk
Author-Name: Neville Verlander
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: The creation and testing of interaction terms in regression models 
 can be very cumbersome, even in Stata 8. We propose a simple wrapping command, 
 -fitint-, that fits any generalised linear model and tests any twoway interactions, 
 as well as all main effects. There is no need to use -xi- because categorical variables 
 are identified with the option. Appropriate tests are chosen depending upon the fitted model.
Keywords: generalized linear model, two-way interactions

Title: GOLOGIT2: Stata module to estimate generalized logistic regression models for ordinal dependent variables
Author-Name: Richard Williams
Author-Email: Richard.A.Williams.5@ND.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Notre Dame
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: gologit2 estimates generalized logistic regression models for ordinal
 dependent variables. A major strength of gologit2 is that it can also
 estimate two special cases of the generalized model: the proportional
 odds model and the partial proportional odds model. Hence, gologit2
 can estimate models that are less restrictive than the proportional
 odds/parallel lines models estimated by ologit (whose assumptions are
 often violated) but more parsimonious and interpretable than those
 estimated by a non-ordinal method, such as multinomial logistic
 regression (i.e. mlogit). Other key strengths of gologit2 include
 options for linear constraints, alternative model parameterizations,
 automated model fitting, Stata 8.2 survey data (svy) estimation, and
 the computation of estimated probabilities via the predict command.
 gologit2 is inspired by Vincent Fu's gologit program and is backward
 compatible with it but offers several additional powerful options.
Keywords: logistic, logistic regression, generalized logit, proportional odds, partial proportional odds
Requires: Stata version 8.2
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
  "ssc install gologit2". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: MMSRM: Stata module to estimate Multidimensional Marginally Sufficient Rasch Model (MMSRM)
Author-Name: Jean-Benoit Hardouin 
Author-Email: jean-benoit.hardouin@neuf.fr
Author-Workplace-Name: Regional Health Observatory, Orl»ans, France
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mmsrm estimates by marginal maximum likelihood (MML) or generalized estimating 
 equations (GEE) the parameters of the Multidimensional Marginally Sufficient Rasch Model 
 (MMSRM). This Item Response Model (IRM) accepts one or several latent traits and is a 
 particular multidimensionnal extension of the Rasch model. In this model, the items are
 separated in Q groups and each group of items is linked to one and only one latent trait. 
 Each group fits a Rasch model relatively to the corresponding latent trait, so the score 
 computed in each group of item is a sufficient statistics of this latent trait 
 (to a specific value of this score is associated only one value for the latent trait).
 The program allows computing the parameter of a MMSRM with less than 4 latent traits. 
 To improve the time of computing, the difficulty parameters are estimated in each 
 unidimensional Rasch model and used as an offset variable to estimate the parameters of 
 the distribution of the multidimensional latent trait. This model allows estimating the 
 correlations between different latent traits measured by Rasch models.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: backrasch realizes a Backward procedure on a Rasch model: the items are 
 removed one per one if they have a bad fit to the Rasch model. The fit of the items 
 is evaluated by a first-order statistics (test R1c, R1m or Q1) It is possible to 
 build several sub-scales of items, the second sub-scale is build with the items 
 unselected in the first sub-scales, the third one with the items unselected in 
 the two first sub-scales, and so on... By default, the parameters of the Rasch 
 model are estimated by conditional maximum likelihood (CML), but it is possible to 
 estimate them by marginal maximum likelihood (MML) or generalized estimating equations (GEE).
 The raschtestv7 package (q.v.) must be installed to use backrasch.

Author-Name: Jean-Benoit Hardouin 
Author-Email: jean-benoit.hardouin@neuf.fr
Author-Workplace-Name: Regional Health Observatory, Orl»ans, France
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: clv clusters variables around latent components. The variables are 
 clustered by searching to minimize at each step the decreasing of the T criterion 
 computed as the sum of the first eigenvalues of the matrices of data of all the 
 clusters. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on this criterion is realized. 
 A consolidation procedure can be run in a second time, which allows assigning 
 each variable to the more correlated latent components. The procedure is 
 described by Vigneau and Qannari (Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation, 2003).

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command creates an exploratory graphic looking at relationships between a binary dependent variable against several explanatory variables. 
 Explanatory variables that have more than 2 values will be dichotomised by its median. When the median is equal to the minimum value this variable will be excluded from the graphic. 
 The graphic consists of two panels, the percentage of people that are coded 1 for the dependent variable for each level of the explanatory variable.
 The second panel plots the relative risk and confidence intervals against the variable name.

Author-Name: Ben Jann
Author-Email: ben.jann@soz.gess.ethz.ch
Author-WorkPlace-Name: ETH Zurich
Author-Person: pja61
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: devcon transforms the coefficients of 0/1 dummy 
 variables so that they reflect deviations from the "grand mean" 
 rather than deviations from the reference category (the 
 transformed coefficients are equivalent to those obtained by the 
 so called "effects coding") and adds the coefficient for the 
 reference category. The variance-covariance matrix of the estimates 
 is transformed accordingly. The transformed estimated can be used 
 with post estimation procedures. In particular, devcon can be used
 to solve the identification problem for dummy variable effects 
 in the so-called Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (see the oaxaca 
 package).

Author-Name: Ben Jann
Author-Email: ben.jann@soz.gess.ethz.ch
Author-WorkPlace-Name: ETH Zurich
Author-Person: pja61
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: cprplot2 is a variation of official Stata's cprplot and
 is used for graphing component-plus-residual plots (a.k.a. partial
 residual plots). Additional features (compared to cprplot): (1) cprplot2 can
 handle variables that enter the model repeatedly via different 
 transformations (for example, polynomials). (2) cprplot2 can display 
 component-plus-residual plots using the original units for transformed 
 variables in the model. (3) A wrapper is provided to quickly display 
 several component-plus-residual plots in a single image.

Title: BIC: Stata module to evaluate the statistical significance of variables in a model
Author-Name: Paul Millar
Author-Email: pemillar@ucalgary.ca
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Calgary
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: bic is a post-estimation command that uses the Bayesian Information Criterion 
 (BIC) for estimating the probability that a variable is part of a model, the 
 equivalent of the statistical significance of a variable's effect. bic estimates
 models based on all possible combinations of the independent variables - it is 
 computationally intensive.  For each of these models it calculates the BIC 
 statistic. It then calculates the probability of each of these models, based 
 on Bayesian principles as first proposed by Schwarz (1978) and further developed
 by Raftery (1995).

Title: LISTMISS: Stata module to analyse missing values related to an estimation command
Author-Name: Paul Millar
Author-Email: pemillar@ucalgary.ca
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Calgary
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: listmiss is a post-estimation command that reports the number of
 missing values for each independent variable.  For each independent 
 variable a flag is created to indicate when the variable is missing.
 The dependent variable is regressed on the missing flag for each 
 independent variable.  The statistical significance of the slope is
 reported as an indicator of whether the dependent variable is 
 statistically different where an independent variable is missing.
 Another test compares the null model to the model with the missing
 flag and performs a BIC difference test, again as an indication of 
 whether the dependent variable is statistically different when an 
 independent variable is missing.
 If the model was specified with robust standard errors, then robust
 standard errors are used to perform the hypothesis test related to 
 the slope for the missing value flag. 
Keywords: missing data, estimation, BIC, regression diagnostics

Title: CLUSTSENS: Stata module to perform sensitivity analysis for cluster commands
Author-Name: Paul Millar
Author-Email: pemillar@ucalgary.ca
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Calgary
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: clustsens is a routine to do a sensitivity analysis of the cluster command. 
 The cluster command groups cases based on the values of a variable, or the 
 mean/median of a group of variables. The results vary depending on the case 
 the process starts at, which is set by the random number seed. The amount 
 of variation is related to the number of variables being averaged together. 
 The more variables averaged, the less variation (shades of the central limit 
 theorem).  At any rate, there will, very likely, be variation - sometimes
 large variation - in the results.  That's what this routine investigates. 
 It simply runs the cluster command multiple times and records the result. 
 The seed is saved (and displayed if the detail option is specified) so that 
 a specific result can be replicated. 
Keywords: cluster, sensitivity

 "ssc install clustsens". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Calgary
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: optifact is a program to find the combination of items that makes the best summated rating scale. 
 Each possible combination of items is called a candidate scale. optifact uses common factor analysis 
 on every candidate scale, does canonical correlation (if requested) on each of the candidate scales, 
 and sorts the candidate scales which have only one dimension in descending order of Cronbach's alpha, 
 for each size of scale. The alphas are not compared across scale sizes, since alpha usually increases 
 with the addition of an item, even if that item does not significantly add to the measurement. 
Keywords: rating, scale, common factor, Cronbach alpha

Abstract: bicdrop1 is a post-estimation command that uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
 to estimate the probability that the model would be more likely after dropping one of 
 the explanatory variables.  The BIC was developed by Raftery (1995).
 It works after the following estimation commands:
 regress, logistic, logit, ologit, oprobit, mlogit, poisson, nbreg. 
 It also reports Akaike's AIC, an earlier measure of model likelihood, and BIC' (BIC 
 prime), an alternative measure proposed by Raftery for model comparison.

Title: LINCHECK: Stata module to graphically assess the linearity of a continuous covariate in a regression model
Author-Name: Alex Gamma
Author-Email: gamma@bli.unizh.ch
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Zurich
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: lincheck provides a quick-and-dirty check of whether a continuous covariate
 in a general linearized model (GLM) is linear in the link function. lincheck
 makes a new categorical variable that breaks the continuous covariate into
 quartiles, then re-estimates the GLM using dummy variables for the
 quartiles, and finally provides a graph of estimated coefficients plotted
 against the midpoints of the quartiles. A linear graph supports the
 assumption of linearity of the continuous covariate. lincheck works with
 most GLM commands such as regress, logit/logistic, probit, poisson, stcox
 etc. and their svy-versions.

Title: BATPLOT: Stata module to produce Bland-Altman plots accounting for trend 
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: The normal Bland-Altman plot is between the difference of paired variables versus 
 their average. This version uses a regression between the difference and the 
 average and then alters the limits of agreement accordingly. This is particularly 
 useful when the two variables might be measured on different scales and hence a 
 straight conversion factor would recalibrate the two variables.

Title: ONESPELL: Stata module to generate single longest spell for each unit in panel data, listwise
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-Workplace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: onespell produces a subset of a panel data set in which all observations 
 on varlist are non-missing and contiguous in the time dimension. If a panel unit 
 contains more than one such subset, the longest "spell" is retained. 
 Although performing this operation for a single variable of interest is fairly straightforward, 
 this routine deals with a more challenging task: generating the single longest spell in a listwise 
 fashion, across a set of variables. This applies the same logic as does, e.g., regress: an 
 observation with a missing value in any variable will be deleted from the regression sample. 
 Some matrix software (e.g., DPD for Ox) requires that panel data be organized in this fashion, 
 with each unit appearing as a single contiguous block of non-missing observations. onespell 
 will produce such a dataset, which after conversion to Stata version 6 format 
 (by, e.g., Stat/Transfer) may be read directly by Ox. The routine has been tested with the latest 
 version of Ox (3.40) and the DPD package (1.21). The routine makes use of N.J. Cox's -tsspell-.
Keywords: panel data, spell, streak, run
Requires: Stata version 8.2

Title: SURFACE: Stata module to draw a 3D wireform surface plot
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  The surface command attempts to draw a wireframe plot from three variables. 
 var1 specifies the x-coordinate, var2 the y-coordinate and var3 the 
 z-coordinate. Alternatively the function can draw a circle at each 
 point and add a straight line going 
 down to the lowest point. 
 This function can handle data that is not in the form of a matrix of values. 
 However if there are too many x- and y- values the function will attempt 
 to round the dataset values into a more reasonable spread of values. This 
 will result in very messy figures. However in s uch a case it is the 
 impression that is needed. Many otehr statistical packages require a full 
 matrix of values. This is not a problem for the nowire option. 
 At present the state of rotating the diagram is limited to interchanging the 
 axes. This is an update of the routine published in STB 51 (gr39).
Keywords: 3d plot, wireform, surface plot
Requires: Stata version 5.0

Title: NSPLIT: Stata module to split numeric variable into components
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: nsplit creates however many new numeric variables it takes to split a numeric
 variable into the specified digit pattern.  So if you have a date variable where
 the first two digits are the month and the last 4 digits are the year, you can
 use nsplit like so: nsplit date, digits(2 4) generate(month year)
Keywords: numeric variables, split, digits
Requires: Stata version 8.2
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
   "ssc install nsplit". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: PROFHAP: Stata module to construct profile likelihood confidence intervals for haplotype analysis
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command fits a series of haplotype association models for various values of the odds ratio. Given the significance level and the chi-squared distribution the confidence upper and lower bounds 
 are estimated. This procedure does not assume that the estimated weights from the EM algorithm to resolve phase are the "true" weights and will give the correct confidence interval. 
Keywords: haplotype, confidence intervals
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install profhap". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: METAPARM: Stata module to perform meta-analysis and transformations using parmest resultssets
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:        The metaparm package contains two resultsset-processing programs, parmcip
      and metaparm, for use with parmest resultssets. metaparm inputs a dataset
      in memory with one observation per parameter and variables containing
      estimates, standard errors and (optionally) degrees of freedom, and creates
      an output dataset with one observation, or one observation per by-group, and
      data on estimates, standard errors, z- or t-statistics, P-values and
      confidence limits for a linear combination (weighted sum) of the input
      parameters, assuming that the input parameters are estimated independently
      for different sub-populations.  The output dataset can be listed to the Stata
      log, saved to a disk file, or written to memory, overwriting the existing
      dataset. metaparm is useful for meta-analyses and for calculating confidence
      intervals and P-values for differences or ratios between parameters for
      different subpopulations.  parmcip inputs a dataset in memory with one
      observation per parameter and variables containing parameter estimates,
      standard errors and (optionally) degrees of freedom, and adds new variables
      to the dataset, containing the confidence limits, z- or t-statistics,
      P-values, and (optionally) stars for P-values.  parmcip is useful if the user
      requires confidence intervals for a transformation of the original
      parameters.
Keywords: meta-analysis, result sets, confidence intervals
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install metaparm". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: rc_spline creates variables that can be used for regression models
 in which the linear predictor f(xvar) is assumed to equal a restricted cubic 
 spline function of an independent variable xvar.  In these regressions, the user
 explicitly or implicitly specifies k knots located at xvar = t1, t2, ..., tk.
 f(xvar) is defined to be a continuous smooth function that is linear before t1,
 is a piecewise cubic polynomial between adjacent knots, and is linear after
 tk.  See Harrell (2001) for additional details.
Keywords: cubic splines, knots, piecewise cubic polynomial

Author-Name: Patrick Royston
Author-Email: pr@ctu.mrc.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: UK Medical Research Council
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This is a version, for Stata 7 up, of the package publicised in Stata
 Journal 4(3):227-241 (2004) implementing the MICE (multivariate
 imputation by chained equations) method of multiple multivariate
 data imputation.  
 This re-release is a beta version. Report problems to the author 
 (who is _not_ on Statalist). In due course it is intended that 
 it will be reissued via 
 the Stata Journal. Among other changes 
 (1) mlogit is now supported by micombine; 
 (2) micombine now allows the id() option to support use independent 
 of the rest of the package (see help micombine). 
Keywords: multivariate imputation, missing values, chained equations
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install mice". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: RFL: Stata module to maintain lists of recently accessed files
Author-Name: Dankwart Plattner
Author-Email: dankwart.plattner@web.de
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: rfl is an enhanced Most Recently Used Files List allowing the user to open a
 dataset from a list of previously opened datasets. Every file opened with rfl
 is added to a list of recently used files and may be accessed via rfl's dialog
 window or Stata's User menu (in Stata 9, also via Stata's Open Recent menu).
 In addition, the user can set the memory allocated to Stata (in fact, rfl
 automatically determines the amount of memory needed to open the dataset), 
 attach a short description to each dataset loaded, and open appropriate log 
 and cmdlog files, all in one step.
 If data are present in memory at the time rfl is called, the user is prompted
 to save and close open files from within rfl's dialog.
 rfl supports file names of any length, even in Stata's non-SE
 Intercooled. Stata 8.2 or 9 is required. Version 3.5 runs on all platforms.
Keywords: file management, data file handling, files list, dialog
Requires: Stata version 8.2
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install rfl". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: PERTURB: Stata module to evaluate collinearity and ill-conditioning
Author-Name: John Hendrickx
Author-Email: J.Hendrickx@mailbox.kun.nl
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Nijmegen
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: perturb is a tool for assessing the impact of small random changes (perturbations)
 to variables on parameter estimates. It is an alternative for collinearity diagnostics such as
 vif, collin, coldiag, coldiag2. perturb is particularly useful for evaluating
 collinearity if interactions are present or nonlinear transformations of variables,
 e.g. a squared term. peturb can show how the perturbations affect the
 estimates of a variable and terms derived from it whereas other collinearity
 diagnostics simply treat interactions and transformations as regular independent
 variables. perturb is not limited to linear regression but can be used for all
 regression-like models. perturb can also deal with categorical variables
 by randomly misclassifying them to assess the impact on parameter estimates.
Keywords: collinearity, conditioning
Requires: Stata version 7.0

Abstract:  This command constructs the Forres plot after a  meta-analysis. 
 Either this command is run immediately after running the command meta (q.v.) or 
 the user will have to input the combined estimate and confidence limits using the combined option.
 The graph requires the parameter estimates and standard errors as the first two variables 
 in the varlist additional a third variable can be included that will be displayed next to
 the study identifiers specified in the id() option. This means that if required the 
 sample sizes per study can be displayed or any other information. Note that the 
 weights used to calculate the size of the study specific estimate symbol are 
 inverse variance weights.

Title: GIPF: Stata module to graphically display a log-linear model 
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  gipf allows the user to graphically display a log-linear model. 
 The graphic consists of nodes, edges represent interactions between nodes a
 nd the edges are non directional. Gipf takes any log-linear model specified 
 using the syntax in ipf. It is particularly useful when trying to understand the 
 conditional independences in models with a large number of variables.
Keywords: graphics, log-linear

Title: ROLLREG: Stata module to perform rolling regression estimation
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: rollreg computes three different varieties of rolling regression estimates. 
 With the move() option, moving-window estimates of the specified window width are computed for the available sample period. 
 With the add() option, that number of periods are initially used for estimation, 
 and the sample is extended one period at a time through the remaining sample. 
 With the dropfirst() option, the regression is estimated for the entire sample, 
 and then repeated, dropping initial observations until that number of observations have been excluded.
 All three forms of the command generate timeseries of R^2s, RMSEs, coefficient estimates and their estimated standard errors for each period.  
 Graphs are also optionally provided, juxtaposing the rolling regression estimates with those
 resulting from a single regression over the entire sample period. The routine can also be applied
 to either a single unit's data from a panel or to panel data.
Keywords: rolling regression, moving window

Title: TWOWAY_ESTFIT: Stata module to enable graph twoway estfit
Author-Name: Michael Blasnik
Author-Email: mblasnik@verizon.net
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: estfit is a modified copy of graph twoway lfit that allows you to specify
 any Stata estimation command instead of the default regress built into lfit
 (or the other defaults of qfit, fpfit, etc.).  For example, you can specify
 using rreg or qreg to get more robust linear fits, or even use it
 with logit or probit to show the fitted relationships.  It should work
 with any estimation command that has a working predict option and can be
 estimated on a simple x/y pair.  Although you can get the same effect by
 just running your estimation command, running predict and then making a line
 graph of the fitted values, by making it a full twoway graph type you get
 access to the power of all of Stata's twoway options, by() is especially
 useful.

Abstract:         senspec inputs a reference variable with two values and a quantitative

      containing, in each observation, the numbers and/or rates of true positives,
      true negatives, false positives and false negatives observed if the
      classification variable is used to define a diagnostic test, with a threshold
      equal to the value of the classification variable for that observation. The
      reference variable indicates the true state of the observation, such as
      diseased and non-diseased, or normal and abnormal. The rating or outcome of
      the diagnostic test is recorded in the classification variable. senspec is
      similar to roctab, but produces output variables instead of plots and
      listings, so that users can create plots and listings in their own chosen

Title: NNMATCH: Stata module to compute nearest-neighbor bias-corrected estimators

Author-Name: Jane Leber Herr
Author-Name: Guido W. Imbens
Author-Name: David M. Drukker
Author-Email: ddrukker@stata.com
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Stata Corporation
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: nnmatch estimates the average treatment effect on depvar 
 by comparing outcomes between treated and control observations (as defined by treatvar), 
 using nearest neighbor matching across the variables defined in varlist_nnmatch. 
 nnmatch can estimate either the treatment effect for the treated observations, 
 for the controls, or for the sample as a whole.
 The program pairs observations to the closest m matches in the opposite treatment group 
 to provide an estimate of the counterfactual treatment outcome.  The program allows for
 matching over a multi-dimensional set of variables (varlist_nnmatch), giving options 
 for the weighting matrix to be used in determining the optimal matches.  It also allows
 exact matching (or as close as possible) on a subset of variables. In addition, the program 
 allows for bias correction of the treatment effect, and estimation of either the sample or
 population variance, with or without assuming a constant treatment effect (homoskedasticity). 
 Finally it allows observations to be used as a match more than once, thus making the order of 
 matching irrelevant. 
Keywords: treatment effects, matching, bias-corrected estimator

Title: DETECT: Stata module to compute the DETECT, Iss and R indexes to test a partition of items
Author-Name: Jean-Benoit Hardouin
Author-Email: jean-benoit.hardouin@neuf.fr
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Regional Health Observatory, Orleans
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: DETECT computes, for a partition of the items, the DETECT, Iss and R indexes defined by 
 Zhang and Stout (1999). These indexes permit to valuate the qualities of a partition of dichotomous 
 items in function of the assumptions of unidimensionality and local independance of the Item Response 
 Theory. The greatest partition of items is one who have the maximal value for DETECT. The DETECT 
 index is maximized to the "good" partition of the items if the items verify an approximate simple 
 structure (obtained if Iss and R indexes egal to 1 to the "good" partition).
Keywords: DETECT, R, Iss, IRT, partition of items, items selection
Requires: Stata version 7
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install detect". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: SWBLOCK: Stata module to perform parsimonious model selection in haplotype analysis
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command systematically fits a series of hapipf 
 log-linear models that models the LD structure within a set of loci.
 The log-linear model is fitted using iterative proportional fitting which 
 is available using ssc and is called 
 ipf (version 1.36 or later). Additionally, the user will also have to 
 install hapipf (version 1.44 or later). This algorithm can handle very large contingency tables and 
 converges to maximum likelihood estimates even when the likelihood is badly behaved. 
Keywords: haplotype analysis
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install swblock". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mvcorr computes a moving-window correlation for tsvar1, tsvar2
 which must be time series variables under the aegis of tsset.  If a
 panel calendar is in effect, the correlation is calculated for each time series
 within the panel. A moving autocorrelation may be computed by using
 time series operators. The moving-window correlation is placed in a new variable,
 specified with the generate() option. Although
 mvcorr works with unbalanced panels (where the start and/or end points differ across units),
 it does not allow gaps within the observations of a time series; that
 is, the value of an observation for a given period may be missing, but the
 observation itself must be defined. Gaps in time series may be dealt with via
 the tsfill command.
Keywords: correlation, autocorrelation, moving window, time series
Requires: Stata version 8.2

Title: MCQSCORE: Stata module to score the Monetary Choice Questionnaire using logistic regression 
Author-Name: E. Paul Wileyto
Author-Email: epw@mail.med.upenn.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Tobacco Use Research Center, School of Medicine, U. of Pennsylvania
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: MCQScore scores the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (questions in 
 standard order), which uses a hyperbolic decay function to summarize
 the degree to which time discounts the value of a delayed reward.  
 The scale parameter k is used as a measure of impulsivity.  
 Conventional scoring requires a lot of hand labor, identifying 
 indifference points where a subject's behavior changes from 
 preferring an immediate to a delayed reward.  Instead, we use 
 logistic regression to identify a contour where the probability of 
 choosing either reward is 0.5, identifying in turn the corresponding 
 hyperbolic function.  Logistic regression is applied to raw binary 
 choices from the survey, modeling the probability of choosing the 
 delayed reward in response to time and a transformation of the reward 
 ratio.  The estimate of k is obtained as a ratio of the two betas.  
 Output will include log-k estimates for small, medium, and large 
 delayed reward sizes, a pooled log-k estimate and the component betas, 
 and optionally, a jackknife estimate of standard error for the pooled 
 log-k estimate and a bias-reduced estimate.  
Keywords: logistic regression, choice, utility
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata 8 by typing

Title: META_LR: Stata module to graph positive and negative likelihood ratios in diagnostic test
Author-Name: Aijing Shang
Author-Email: shang@ispm.unibe.ch
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University Berne, Switzerland
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: meta_lr does mainly two things: it can do stratified meta-analysis of individual estimates 
 theta1 and theta2 by stratavariables, save the stratified pooled estimates and 
 their confidence intervals in new data set and draw them in one graph; if stratified variables are not
 given, meta_lr draw theta1 and theta2 and their confidence interval by individual study
 in one graph, with or without weighting. Combined meta-analysis results are shown in star.
 This command is mainly used to draw graph in diagnostic test. The user provides the effect estimate as thetas 
 (e.g., log positive likelihood ratio and log negative likelihood ratio). Likewise, the user provides the 
 standard error of thetas. 
 Commands meta (STB-38, sbe16) and metareg (STB-42, sbe23) must be installed before using this command.
Keywords: meta-analysis, likelihood ratio
Requires: Stata version 8.2; STB routines meta and metareg

Title: PGMHAZ8: Stata module to estimate discrete time (grouped data) proportional hazards models
Author-Name: Stephen P. Jenkins
Author-Email: stephenj@essex.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Essex
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: pgmhaz8 estimates by ML two discrete time (grouped data) proportional
 hazards regression models, one of which incorporates a gamma mixture 
 distribution to summarize unobserved individual heterogeneity
 (or 'frailty').  Covariates may include regressor variables 
 summarizing observed differences between persons (either 
 fixed or time-varying), and variables summarizing the duration 
 dependence of the hazard rate.  With suitable definition of 
 covariates, models with a fully non-parametric specification 
 for duration dependence may be estimated; so too may parametric 
 specifications. pgmhaz8 thus provides a useful complement to 
 stcox (for continuous survival time data), and related programs.
Keywords: duration data, survival, proportional hazards, frailty
Requires: Stata version 8.0

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:          The regaxis package contains 2 programs, named regaxis and logaxis.
      regaxis generates a regular linear axis range and tick list for a list of
      variables and/or numbers to be included in the axis range. logaxis generates
      a regular logarithmic axis range and tick list for a list of variables and/or
      numbers to be included in the axis range.  Both programs can output the
      elements of the axis range and/or tick list to be stored in local and/or
      global macros, which can then be used in Stata graphics commands as axis
      options and suboptions, such as the the range() suboption of the xscale() and
      yscale() options, or the xlabel() ylabel(), xtick() and ytick() options.

Title: RBOUNDS: Stata module to perform Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis for average treatment effects on the treated
Author-Name: Markus Gangl
Author-Email:  gangl@wz-berlin.de
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Social Science Centre Berlin (WZB)
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: rbounds calculates Rosenbaum bounds for average treatment effects on 
 the treated in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity (hidden bias) 
 between treatment and control cases. rbounds takes the difference in the 
 response variable between treatment and control cases as input variable 
 varname. The procedure then calculates Wilcoxon signrank tests that give 
 upper and lower bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of 
 hidden bias. Under the assumption of additive treatment effects, rbounds 
 also provides Hodges-Lehmann point estimates and confidence intervals for 
 the average treatment effect on the treated. If installed, the input variable 
 varname may be generated from psmatch or psmatch2. Currently, 
 rbounds implements the sensitivity tests for matched (1x1) pairs only.
Keywords: sensitivity, treatment, Rosenbaum, unobserved heterogeneity

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: tableplot plots the values of a variable in a two-way table format
 specified by two other variables, which define rows from top to
 bottom and columns from left to right. The value for each
 combination of row and column is shown according to a specified
 plottype, one of rbar, rcap, rcapsym or rspike, with default
 alignment vertical.  The value must be unique for each such
 combination. 
Keywords: graphics, tables, categorical data   
Requires: Stata version 8.0

Title: GMLABVPOS: Stata module providing egen function for label positioning
Author-Name: Ulrich Kohler
Author-Email: kohler@wz-berlin.de
Author-WorkPlace-Name: WZB
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: _gmlabvpos is an attempt to automatically generate a variable for the
 clockpositions of marker labels in scatterplots. That is, the command generates
 a variable which can be filled into the scatter option mlabvpos().
 Note that the program does not attempt to prevent marker labels from overploting, which is quite
 likely in dataset with many observations. In such situations you might be better off in simply 
 make randomized clock positions.
 The general idea behind _gmlabvpos is to pull the marker label away from the 
 data-region. For example, marker symbols in the lower left edge of the data 
 region are labeled at clock-position 7 or 8, and marker symbols in the upper right 
 edge of the data region are labeled at clock-position 1 or 2, etc.

Title: ABAR: Stata module to perform Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation 
Author-Name: David Roodman
Author-Email: DRoodman@CGDEV.ORG
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Center for Global Development
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:   abar performs the Arellano-Bond (1991) test for autocorrelation.
 The test was originally proposed for a particular linear Generalized Method of Moments 
 dynamic panel data estimator, but is quite general in its applicability--more general 
 than dwstat, durbina, bgodfrey, and xtserial.
 It can be applied to linear GMM regressions in general, and thus to ordinary least squares (OLS) 
 and two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regressions, which can be seen as special cases of linear GMM.
 It is appropriate for both time-series and cross-section time-series (panel) regressions.
 It can also be made consistent in the presence of various patterns of error covariance.
 Specifically, abar will run after regress, ivreg, ivreg2, and ivreg2, gmm in their "plain" 
 (homoskedastic), robust, and cluster variants.
 It will also run after newey and newey2.
 In the context of an Arellano-Bond GMM regression, which is run on first differences, 
 AR(1) is to be expected, and therefore the Arellano-Bond AR(1) test result is usually ignored in that context.
 The AR(2) test on the residuals in first differences is used to detect AR(1) in the underlying levels variables.
 But in other contexts, such as simple OLS in levels, the AR(1) test is relevant.
 abar is not appropriate for fixed-effects regressions for dynamic models, assuming those are done via a mean-deviation transformation.
 This is because the Arellano-Bond AR() test assumes that right-hand-side variables are not "post-determined," 
 i.e., not correlated with future errors.
 In a dynamic setting, future values of regressors can depend on future errors. And after the 
 mean-deviations transformation, future values of the original regressors affect 
 current values of the transformed versions.
Keywords: Arellano-Bond, autocorrelation, GMM, regression

Title: CVXHULL: Stata module to compute and plot convex hulls of bivariate data
Author-Name: R. Allan Reese
Author-Email: r.a.reese@cefas.co.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: CEFAS
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: cvxhull identifies points defining the convex hulls of a group of
 points in two-dimensional space. Each hull is defined by two lines
 joining the bottom-left point to the top-right point. The data are
 sorted within the routine but sortpreserve returns the data to
 their original order after the call, whether or not it was completed.
 The routine may be called repeatedly to calculate a variety of hulls.
 The routines provide a complete replacement for gr16 (STB-23).

Author-Name: Ben Jann
Author-Email: ben.jann@soz.gess.ethz.ch

Author-Person: pja61
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: splitvallabels splits the value labels for a variable into multiple chunks,
 and returns those chunks in a form appropriate for specification as part of a graph
 command.
 When the over() variable in, for example, a bar graph has long labels, these
 labels can overlap each other in the graph.  This command breaks up these long labels
 and packages them in a format appropriate for specification as part of a relabel option.
 This will create multi-line labels on the graph.
Keywords: graphics, labels

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: tarow tabulates two numeric variables in order, row by column.  Thereafter, provides, by each row
    level defined by the first variable, varname1, (1st level, 2nd level, ...) a 2Xn table where
    n equals the number of columns defined by the levels of the second variable, varname2. The
    two rows for each 2Xn table are level i and all other.
    tarowi tabulates row by column a table defined by the matrix definition syntax.  Thereafter,
    provides, by each row level (row==1, row==2, ...) a 2Xn table where n equals the number of
    columns defined by the columns of the matrix definition.  The two rows for each 2Xn table are
    row==i and all other.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  reshape8 improves reshape by preserving variable labels as much as 
 possible when switching back and forth between long and wide dataset 
 formats. Hence, taking a dataset from long to wide and back to long will 
 result in getting the same dataset labelling back again.  When going from 
 wide to long, there are some labels which are not defined; if they are 
 then defined and the dataset is reshaped multiple times, they will be 
 persistent.

Title: VTOKENIZE: Stata module to split a variable into its tokens 
Author-Name: Bill Rising
Author-Email:  brising@louisville.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name:  University of Louisville
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  vtokenize and vgettoken do for variables what tokenize and 
 gettoken do for strings in Stata. The main use of this is for dealing 
 with nasty datasets.
 vtokenize splits every observation into its tokens, creating as many 
 variables as needed to hold the tokens.
 vgettoken pulls the first token off every observation of a variable, 
 placing the result in a variable of the user's choice, optionally placing 
 the remainder into yet another variable.
 Both commands allow user-specified delimiter lists and both allow either 
 treating the delimiters as tokens or ignoring them completely.

Title: XTABOND2: Stata module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator 
Author-Name: David Roodman
Author-Email: DRoodman@CGDEV.ORG
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Center for Global Development
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data models. The first is the
    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which is also available with xtabond without the two-step
    finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an augmented version outlined in
    Arellano and Bover (1995) and fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).
    Arellano and Bond (1991) developed a Generalized Method of
    Moments estimator that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time period.
    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment condition sets.  The predetermined and
    endogenous variables in first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their own
    levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any other instruments, can enter the
    instrument matrix in the conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first differences,
    with one column per instrument.
    A problem with the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are often poor
    instruments for first differences, especially for variables that are close to a random
    walk.  Arellano and Bover (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
    added to the system, additional moment conditions could be brought to bear to increase
    efficiency.  In these equations, predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
    instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.  Blundell and Bond (1998)
    articulated the necessary assumptions for this augmented estimator more precisely and
    tested it with Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes called
    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM." Bond (2002) is a good introduction
    to these estimators and their use.
    xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step variants.  But
    though asymptotically more efficient, the two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to
    be severely downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).  To
    compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a finite-sample correction to the
    two-step covariance matrix derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
    efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
    Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with the 21jun2002 update installed).

Abstract: savastata SAS macro when implemented by the SAS System saves the most 
 recently created SAS dataset in the work library to a Stata dataset.  savastata 
 requires that you have a working copy of SAS and a working copy of Stata Intercooled or 
 SE on your computer to run successfully.  If your SAS dataset is small enough savastata 
 may work on Small Stata (Student Version).  If your SAS dataset is using formats that 
 are in a formats catalog (work.formats or library.formats), savastata will make an attempt 
 to preserve them as value labels in Stata.  Stata does not allow all the variations of 
 user-defined formats that SAS offers.  Savastata may take a few minutes to save your 
 dataset.  savastata will work in SAS interactive mode or in SAS batch mode.  
 savastata will run on various operating systems including: Windows, Red Hat Linux, AIX.  
 It may work fine on others as well.

Title: SHORTDIR: Stata module to return the short Windows directory path name
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: shortdir is designed for programmers who want to know what the short
  directory name (a.k.a. "8.3" name) that DOS names a directory when it contains
  spaces in the name or has more than 8 characters in the name.  This command only
  works in Windows because it shells out to a DOS prompt in order to get the
  short directory name that Windows came up with.  The formula "Take the first
  6 non-space characters and add '~1'" to the directory name does not reliably
  work in all situations.
Keywords: 8.3, directory, short
Requires: Stata version 8.0 for Windows
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
   "ssc install shortdir". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: CONFIRMDIR: Stata module to confirm if a directory exists
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: confirmdir is designed for programmers who want to know if a directory exists.
  This is just like confirm command when used to confirm a file.  If Stata allowed their
  confirm command to also have the "dir" option, this program would not have been written.
  Stata's -confirm file- will confirm a directory in Unix/Linux but not in Windows.  Confirmdir works in
  all operating systems.
Keywords: confirm, directory, exists
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing

Title: TMPDIR: Stata module to indicate the directory Stata is using for a temporary directory
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: tmpdir is designed for programmers who want to know what directory
  Stata writes temp files to.  This can be helpful when using the file command to
  write intermediary files for a program.  Since spaces in directory names can cause
  problems for programs running in Windows operating system, tmpdir replaces
  directory / subdirectory names that contain spaces, or optionally any name
  longer than 8 characters, with the first 6 non-space characters plus "~1" or
  "~2" (up to "~4").  After that it gets a bit crazy with hexadecimal replacements.
  Tmpdir shells out to DOS and finds the short directory name that DOS has come
  up with, so there's no attempt to guess the short name.  This makes it possible to
  use this program on many different versions of Windows and always get the short name right.  
  Tmpdir works on all operating systems.
Keywords: tempdir, directory, temporary
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
   "ssc install tmpdir". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: USESAS: Stata module to use a SAS dataset
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: usesas loads a SAS datafile into memory.  This usually occurs by supplying
  usesas a SAS dataset (*.sas7bdat, *.sd7, *.sd2, *.ssd01, *.xpt) or SPSS portable files (*.por),
  but usesas can also load a SAS datafile into memory via a SAS program (*.sas) that creates a
  SAS dataset.  The last dataset created  by the SAS program will be the SAS dataset
  processed by usesas. Usesas calls SAS to run a SAS program.  This requires the
  ability to run SAS on your machine.  Usesas works on Windows, Unix, and Linux
 operating systems.
Keywords: SAS, use, convert, transfer
Requires: Stata version 8.0

Title: SAVASAS: Stata module to save your dataset as a SAS dataset
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: savasas saves the Stata dataset in memory as a SAS file.  By default
  the output dataset will have the same name and be in the same directory,
  but with the .sas7bdat file name extension and contain all observations and
  every variable in the Stata data file.  Savasas can save to other versions of SAS.
  Version 8: *.sas7bdat, Version 6: *.ssd01/ *.sd2, SAS 6 Transport/xport: .xpt.
  Savasas calls SAS to run the SAS program.  This requires the ability to
  run SAS on your computer.  If you do not have a working copy of SAS, use the sascode
  option and copy the SAS program (mySASfile_infile.sas) and the xport data file
  (mySASfile_infile.raw) to a computer that has a working copy of SAS.
  The SAS program will need to be modified to point to the location of 
 the xport data file.  Savasas works on Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems.
Keywords: SAS, save, convert, transfer
Requires: Stata version 8.1 (updated with the fdasave command)
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
   "ssc install savasas". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: LOOKFORIT: Stata module to search variable names and labels for some string or strings
Author-Name: Dan Blanchette
Author-Email: dan_blanchette@unc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: lookforit is an enhancement of the base Stata command lookfor.  It searches all variable
  names and variable labels just as lookfor does.  Like lookfor lookforit can search for
  multiple strings but can only do a simple search, i.e. no &'s, |'s, or enclosing strings in
  quotes.  The ways that lookforit differs from lookfor are as follows: 1) lookforit 
 does a case sensitive search if the user types any upper case 
 characters, otherwise, it performs a case insensitive search, 2) 
 lookforit lists variables alphabetically, 3) the listed variable names are 
 clickable links to the data editor that opens Stata's data editor to 
 that variable column.
Keywords: lookfor, find, variable, names, search, labels, look
Requires: Stata version 8.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing
   "ssc install lookforit". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: NEARMRG: Stata module to provide nearest-match merging of datasets
Author-Name: Michael Blasnik
Author-Email: michael.blasnik@verizon.net
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: nearmrg performs nearest match merging of two datasets.  nearmrg matches
 observations that are closest on the variable specified in nearvar().  Options upper,
 lower, and roundup allow some adjustments to how closest is defined.  Additional 
 variables may be specified in an optional varlist and these variables are treated as 
 standard merge variable which must match exactly.  This option allows nearest matching 
 within subsets defined by the varlist.  nearmrg was designed as a way to use 
 lookup tables that have binned or rounded values on the variable of interest.
Keywords: merge, fuzzy merge, nearest neighbor
Requires: Stata version 8.1

Title: MKCORR: Stata module to generate correlation table formatted for easy inclusion in articles
Author-Name: Glenn Hoetker
Author-Email: ghoetker@uiuc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mkcorr produces a correlation table in a format that is easy to 
 import into a spreadsheet or word processing document.  In this, it is
 inspired by the indispensable mktab and outreg commands.  By writing the output
 directly to a logfile, it avoids two problems with taking correlationtables from
 the results window.  First, it allows an effectively unlimited number of
 variables without wrapping around.  Second, it requires less post-processing in a
 spreadsheet or word-processor, particularly for more involved tables.  It also
 offers a number of small advantages such as allowing the use of labels, controlling the 
 number of decimal places used, and other formating options.
Keywords: correlation, tables, publication output
Requires: Stata version 8.0

Abstract: nicedates shows a numlist of "nice" dates as determined
 by _tsnatscale for timevar, which is normally a time
 variable. nicedates examines the display format of timevar
 to determine whether it includes daily, weekly, monthly,
 quarterly, half-yearly or yearly dates. If in doubt, the
 guess will be yearly, which implies that nicedates will
 give sensible answers with numeric variables other than
 dates. The list of nice dates is accessible after
 nicedates as r(dates).

Title: CORRTAB: Stata module to display correlation coefficients in a formatted tabular output
Author-Name: Fred Wolfe
Author-Email: fwolfe@arthritis-research.org
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: corrtab  provides a rapid display of correlations formatted for easy 
 reading and for copying to reports and manuscripts. It optionally makes use of 
 advanced labeling systems to provide clear and useful display suitable for the 
 screen and for word-processors. corrtab displays Pearson or Spearman rank correlations.  
 The default calculation of individual correlation coefficients is made independently and 
 thus the display contains the pairwise coefficients. Optionally, casewise deletion 
 can be requested. The sample size and a test of independence are also reported 
 optionally. String variables are automatically omitted from the analytic processing. 
 Multiple, duplicative variable designations can be selected to enable full capture of 
 intended variables; duplicate variables specified in the varlist are removed before 
 processing. corrtab is a version 8 upgrade of pwcorrs (q.v.).

Title: MLBOOLEAN: Stata module to implement Boolean logit and probit
Author-Name: Bear F. Braumoeller
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Harvard University
Author-Email: bfbraum@fas.harvard.edu
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: Boolean logit and probit are a family of partial-observability 
 n-variate models designed to permit researchers to model causal complexity, 
 or multiple causal "paths" to a given outcome.  The various "paths" are modeled 
 as latent dependent variables that are multiplied together in a manner 
 determined by the logic of their (Boolean) interaction.  If, for example, 
 we wanted to model a situation in which diet OR smoking causes heart failure, 
 we would use one set of independent variables (caloric intake, fat intake, etc.) 
 to predict the latent probability of diet-related coronary failure (y1*), use 
 another set of variables (cigarettes smoked per day, exposure to second-hand 
 smoke, etc.) to predict the latent probability of smoking-related coronary 
 failure (y2*), and model the observed outcome (y, or coronary failure) as a 
 function of the Boolean interaction of the two: Pr(y=1) = 1-([1-y1*] x [1-y2*]).  
 Any combination of ANDs and ORs can be posited, and the interaction of up to five 
 latent variables can be modeled.  See Bear F. Braumoeller (2003), 
 "Causal Complexity and the Study of Politics," Political Analysis 11(3): 209-233, 
 for further details. This routine was previously available from SSC as boolean, 
 which has now been removed.

Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:            xcollapse is an extended version of collapse, which creates a data set with
      one observation per combination of values of a list of variables in the
      existing data set and new variables containing summary statistics of other
      variables (eg means) in each combination. xcollapse allows the user to choose
      the destination of the output data set, which may either be listed to the
      Stata log, or saved to a disk file, or written to the memory (overwriting any
      existing data set).
Keywords: data manipulation, summary statistics

Abstract:       xcontract is an extended version of contract. It creates a data set with one
      observation per combination of values of a list of variables in the existing
      data set and new variables containing the frequency and percent of each
      combination, and, optionally, the cumulative frequency and percent of each
      combination. By-variables can be used with xcontract, and the percents
      will then be calculated within by-groups. The output data set may either be
      listed to the Stata log, or saved to a disk file, or written to the memory
      (overwriting any existing data set).

Title: WCLOGIT: Stata module to perform conditional logistic regression with within-group varying weights
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command maximises the partial log-likelihood for conditional logistic regression with
 weights that can vary within the matched set defined by the group option. In calculations
 the Breslow likelihood as specified in the Stata manual. Note that only one case is
 allowed within one group so no ties are possible and that frequency weights are not allowed.
 In other words the dataset should be expanded to an "individual data" format.
 The main application for this function would be when you have inverse probability weights
 to correct for any bias introduced in selecting members of each group. A typical
 epidemiological design would be the case-cohort study where every case from a larger cohort
 is included in the analysis but a smaller random sample of all possible controls are included.

Title: MITOOLS: Stata module of tools for analyzing multiple imputed datasets

Author-Name: Carolyn Coffey
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  The method of multiple imputation (MI) is used increasingly for 
 analyzing datasets with missing observations. Two sets of tasks are required in 
 order to implement the method: (a) generating multiple complete datasets 
 in which missing values have been imputed by simulating from an appropriate 
 probability distribution and (b) analyzing the multiple imputed datasets and 
 combining complete data inferences from them to form an overall inference for 
 parameters of interest. The Stata tools published here address task (b) and 
 enable analysis of multiple datasets to be performed with similar ease to the 
 analysis of a single dataset. These commands not only implement techniques for 
 inference from multiple imputed datasets but also allow standard manipulations 
 such as transformation and recoding of variables.

Title: WHOTDECK: Stata module to perform multiple imputation using the Approximate Bayesian Bootstrap with weights
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: whotdeck will tabulate the missing data patterns within the varlist.
 A row of data with missing values in any of the variables in the varlist
 is defined as a `missing line' of data, similarly a `complete line' is one where 
 all the variables in the varlist contain data. The whotdeck procedure
 replaces the varlist variables in the `missing lines' with the 
 corresponding values in the `complete lines'.
 whotdeck should be used several times within a multiple imputation 
 sequence since missing data 
 are imputed stochastically, with weights determined by a logistic regression model of the missing
 data process, rather than deterministically. 
Keywords: data manipulation, multiple imputation, Bayesian bootstrap

Abstract: dmariano calculates a measure of predictive accuracy proposed by Diebold
 and Mariano (1995). Given an actual series and two competing predictions, 
 one may apply a loss criterion (such as squared error or absolute error)
 and then calculate a number of measures of predictive accuracy that allow the
 null hypothesis of equal accuracy to be tested. The S(1) measure, calculated in this routine,
 tests that the mean difference between the loss criteria for the two predictions
 is zero, using a long-run estimate of the variance of the difference series.

Title: EQPRHISTOGRAM: Stata module for equal probability histogram
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: eqprhistogram shows a histogram constructed so that each bar 
 represents the same fraction of the data. As an example, 
 suppose we calculate the minimum, the lower quartile, the 
 median, the upper quartile and the maximum of a variable.
 These 5 quantiles allow us to draw a histogram with 4 bars, 
 each representing 1/4 of the total (possibly weighted) 
 frequency, or of the total probability 1. The height of 
 each bar representing the average probability density in 
 each interval should be 1 / 4 * (upper quantile - lower 
 quantile). eqprhistogram refuses to draw graphs when the 
 quantiles calculated are not distinct. This is likely with 
 categorical or discrete or highly rounded data, especially 
 as the number of quantiles approaches the number of values. 
Keywords: graphics, histogram, frequency distributions

Title: MVPROBIT: Stata module to calculate multivariate probit regression using simulated maximum likelihood
Author-Name: Lorenzo Cappellari
Author-Workplace-Name: Universit˝ del Piemonte Orientale and University of Essex 
Author-Name: Stephen P. Jenkins
Author-Email: stephenj@essex.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Essex
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mvprobit estimates M-equation probit models, by the method of 
 simulated maximum likelihood (SML). (Cf. probit and biprobit 
 which estimate 1-equation and 2-equation probit models by maximum likelihood.) 
 The variance-covariance matrix of the cross-equation error terms has values of 
 1 on the leading diagonal, and the off-diagonal elements are correlations 
 to be estimated. mvprobit uses the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) simulator 
 to evaluate the M-dimensional Normal integrals in the likelihood 
 function. For each observation, a likelihood contribution is calculated 
 for each replication, and the simulated likelihood contribution is the 
 average of the values derived from all the replications. The simulated 
 likelihood function for the sample as a whole is then maximized using 
 standard methods (ml in this case).
Keywords: multivariate probit, simulated maximum likelihood
Requires: Stata version 7.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install mvprobit". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Author-Name: Thomas Steichen 
Author-Email: steichen@triad.rr.com
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: metan is for performing aggregate level meta-analyses. Studies may be
 combined using the inverse variance or Der Simonian & Laird weights.
 If the data are in the form of two proportions, the Mantel-Haenszel
 method and the Yusuf-Peto "one-step" method may be used to combine
 the tables. Alternatively, the user may define their own weights.
 funnel is an update to the previously-distributed funnel2 command. The most important change is 
 that the ordering of the variable list has been changed, to make it 
 consistent with other meta-analysis commands (eg meta, metabias).
 labbe is an update to the labbe program, which produces L'Abbe plots for  
 binary data; that is, a graph of the two proportions against each other. 
 This offers an alternative display of the data, and is also potentially 
 useful in deciding whether the assumption of a common odds ratio, risk 
 ratio or risk difference is reasonable. The newly added options allow the
 user to superimpose lines that relate to a constant effect on each scales.
 metannt is a new program which may be used for binary data. It displays 
 effects in terms of the absolute reduction in risk and number needed to 
 treat.

Title: MYLABELS: Stata module for axis labels or ticks on transformed scales or for daily dates

Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Author-Name: Scott Merryman
Author-Email: smerryman@kc.rr.com
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mylabels and myticks generate axis labels and ticks on
 transformed scales. Their use is best explained by example.
 You draw a graph and one axis is on a transformed square
 root scale. You wish the axis labels to show untransformed
 values. For some values this is easy; for example,
 ylabel(0 1 2 "4" 3 "9" 4 "16" 5 "25") says use "4" as
 label for 2, and so forth. For other values and/or other
 transformations the conversion may be more difficult to do in your
 head. The idea behind mylabels is that you feed it the numeric
 labels you want shown and the transformation being used.
 It will then place the appropriate specification in a local
 macro which you name. You may then use that local macro as
 part of a later graphics command. The idea behind myticks 
 is similar. 
 mydays displays a formatted list of specified days that lie within the
 range of a tsset daily date variable describing a time series and puts
 the numeric version of that list in a specified local macro. The result
 may be useful for specifying axis label or tick positions on graphs of
 time series. mydays requires Stata 9.0.
Keywords: graphics, transformations, axis labels, axis ticks, daily dates, time series
Requires: Stata version 8.0 (9.0 for mydays)

Title: INGAP: Stata module to insert gap observations into a data set before output by listtex
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:   ingap inserts gap and/or heading observations into a data set before the
      data set is output by the listtex package (q.v.), which
      outputs variables to table rows which the user can insert into a TeX, LaTeX,
      HTML or Microsoft Word table. ingap inserts observation next to (before or
      after) each of a list of observations specified by the user. The user
      specifies a list of integers, and ingap inserts gap observations next to
      the observations in the corresponding positions in the data set, or in the
      corresponding positions in each by-group if by-variables are specified.
      ingap assumes that the data set in memory has up to 3 classes of variables.
      These are the by-variables which define by-groups representing the pages of
      the table, a row label variable containing the row labels in the left margin
      of the table, and the remaining variables, which may form the entries in the
      table rows. A gap observation inserted by ingap has the same values for the
      by-variables as the observation next to which it was inserted, a row label
      value specified by the user, and missing values (or possibly column headings)
      in the remaining variables. ingap may also create an additional binary
      variable, identifying which observations are gap observations. The user may
      output the data set using listtex, or may alternatively create a plot for
      immediate impact, using Stata graphics together with the sencode package
      (q.v.).

 robust regression based on resampling schemes. (An example is
 REDI.SRC in this archive, which is effective when there are no
 dummy variables.)

Author-Email: eb01@business.swt.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Southwest Texas State University 
Programming-Language: RATS
Abstract:  
 Given a sample from a univariate distribution, robskew
 computes the quartile skewness (qs), a robust measure of
  asymmetry. classical skewness measures (including those
  reported by the RATS command 'statistics') are based on
  the sample moments and are therefore quite vulnerable to
  outliers. a few anomalous observations can make a symmetric
  distribution look skew or vice versa. qs is less affected
  by contaminated data.
Keywords: skewness, robust

Abstract: eclplot ("Estimates and Confidence Limits Plot") is a Stata 9 graphics 
 package, complete with a dialog to save the user from having to memorise too 
 many "options within options". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.  It creates plots of estimates and confidence 
 intervals on one axis against another numeric variable on the other axis. 
 The estimates and confidence limits are in variables specified by the user. 
 Data sets containing such variables may be created by the parmest package 
 (downloadable from SSC), or by statsby or postfile in official Stata. The 
 user has the options of horizontal or vertical confidence interval plots, and 
 a choice of graphical formats for the confidence limits, and may also overlay 
 other plots using the plot option.

Author-WorkPlace-Name: Dipartimento di Prevenzione Az. USL Ba/1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: In survival or cohort studies the failure of an individual may be one of several distinct 
 failure types. In such a situation we observe an event of interest and one or more competing
 events whose occurrence precludes or alters the probability of occurence of the first one.
 stcompet creates variables containing Cumulative Incidence, a function that in this case
 appropriately estimates the probability of occurrence of each endpoint, corresponding Standard Error
 and Confidence Bounds.
 The values in numlist of the previous stset are assumed as occurrence of event of interest.
 In compet() options you can specify numlist relating to the occurrence of up to six 
 competing events.

Title: LINCOMEST: Stata module to generate linear combinations of estimators saved as estimation results
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: lincomest is an extension to -lincom-, which calculates confidence 
 intervals and P-values for linear combinations of model coefficients. 
 lincomest is an eclass command, and saves the estimate and variance of the 
 linear combination as estimation results, with the option of holding any 
 existing estimation results to be recalled later by estimates unhold. 
 The advantage of doing this is that the linear combination can be input 
 to the parmest package to create a data set with one observation 
 containing a confidence interval and P-value for the linear combination, 
 or to list that data set to the Stata log in a user-defined format.  
 This data set can be concatenated with other parmest output data sets 
 using the dsconcat package, and the confidence intervals and/or P-values 
 can then be plotted and/or tabulated.
Keywords: estimation results, confidence intervals

Title: FEDIT: Stata module to find and edit text file from within Stata
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: fedit finds a text file along the path searched by findfile, 
 which is by default the adopath, and then fires up a text 
 editor to examine that file. The version of fedit distributed 
 from SSC fires up the inbuilt Stata do file editor doedit. 
 fedit will be most useful to those wishing to use a text 
 editor of their choice from within Stata with minimal typing, 
 in particular without spelling out the paths of the file and 
 of the editor executable. Users are encouraged to modify

Abstract: charlist displays a sorted list of the distinct characters

 charlist may, for example, reveal the presence of problematic
 characters in a string variable which "should be" numeric.
 It leaves behind a terse character list in r(chars); a
 space-separated character list in r(sepchars); and a
 space-separated numlist of ASCII codes in r(ascii). Any may
 be used in a subsequent command. Sometimes copying and
 pasting all or part of the displayed output to the command
 window may be the most practical way to use the output, say
 as argument to destring, ignore().

Abstract: sunflower draws density distribution sunflower plots.  These plots are useful 
	for displaying bivariate data whose density is too great for conventional 
	scatter plots to be effective.  A sunflower is a number of line segments of 
	equal length, called petals, that radiate from a central point.  There are 
	two varieties of sunflowers: light and dark.  Each petal of a light sunflower
	represents one observation.  Each petal of a dark sunflower represents a 
	specific number of observations specified by the user.  The program uses dark
	and light sunflowers to represent high and medium density regions of the data,
	and dots or circles to represent individual observations in low density 
	regions.

Title: AUTOLOG: Stata module to generate dialog to create log files
Author-Name: Ian Watson 
Author-Email: iangwatson@pnc.com.au
Author-Workplace-Name: ACIRRT, University of Sydney
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: autolog is a utility designed for use in Stata's profile.do 
 file (though it can be used interactively if desired).
 autolog causes a dialogue box to pop up every time Stata starts 
 and prompts the user for a filename for the log file. This allows
 the user to easily enter project filenames depending on what analysis
 is underway. autolog is also designed to overcome the common 
 frustration of forgetting to send output to a log file at the 
 start of a session.

Title: QROWNAME: Stata module to extract lists of quoted row and column names from a matrix

Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: qrowname returns lists of double-quoted row equations, row names and row full names
 for a matrix specified by matrix_name.
 qcolname returns lists of double-quoted column equations, column names and column full names
 for a matrix specified by matrix_name.
 The lists are stored in the saved results r(eq), r(name) and
 r(fullname), containing lists of quoted row/column equation names, quoted row/column names
 and quoted row/column full names, respectively.
 The two commands work similarly to the macro extended functions roweq,
 coleq, rownames, colnames, rowfullnames and colfullnames,
 but, unlike the macro extended functions, they return each name in double quotes. This is useful
 when row and column equations contain spaces or even single quotes, as sometimes happens with equation names
 for matrix estimation results generated by mlogit when the multinomial
 outcome variable has value labels.
 The returned lists can then be assigned to other matrices using the matrix roweq,
 matrix coleq, matrix rownames and matrix colnames
 commands.

Abstract:   The archive contains Gauss programs for weighted kernel density estimation, and cross-validation.
 The same procedures can be used for non-parametric regression, which is a special case
 of weighted kernel density estimate, with the weights being given by the dependent variable.
 Currently, there are three choices for the kernel function (normal, standardized quartic,
 and unstandardized quartic). Other options include rotating the data, and adjusting
 for the presence of discrete regressors. See the description at the beginning of each file
 for details. The code uses a direct implementation, and may be slow for large data sets.

Author-Name: Yuriy Tchamourliyski

Author-Email:  tchamour@bc.edu 
Abstract:   The archive contains fast implementation of the Gauss program for weighted kernel density
 estimation. The code runs substantially faster (about 20 times faster) compared to the
 direct implementation, however this version works only under Gauss for Windows (requires
 dlibrary). The code uses a dll library compiled from Fortran code, and callable from the
 Windows version of Gauss. The Fortran code is also included, and can be used to compile a
 library callable from Gauss for Dos, and Gauss for Unix. See the Readme file for details.
 This version does not allow the user to change the kernel weighting function (the default
 is the standardized quartic kernel), or distinguish between continuous and discrete
 regressors when calculating the weighted density estimate.

Title: TABCOUNT: Stata module to tabulate frequencies, with zeros explicit
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: tabcount tabulates frequencies for up to 7 variables.  
 Its main distinctive features are that zero frequencies 
 of one or more specified values or conditions are always 
 shown in the table (i.e. entirely empty rows, columns, etc. 
 are not omitted) and that reduced datasets and/or matrices 
 containing the frequencies may also be saved. This 
 version of tabcount is 2.0.0 and requires Stata 8. 
 A previous version, much restricted, of tabcount for 
 Stata 7 is included in this package as tabcount7. 
Keywords: tabulation, zeros 
Series: Statistical Software Components
Requires: Stata version 8.0 (7.0 for tabcount7)
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install tabcount". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: IVENDOG: Stata module to calculate Durbin-Wu-Hausman endogeneity test after ivreg

Author-WorkPlace-Name: Motu Economic and Public Policy Research
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: ivendog computes a test for endogeneity in a regression estimated via
   instrumental variables (IV), the null hypothesis for which states that an
   ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the same equation would yield 
   consistent estimates: that is, any endogeneity among the regressors 
   would not have deleterious effects on OLS estimates. A rejection of the null 
   indicates that endogenous regressors' effects on the estimates are meaningful, 
   and instrumental variables techniques are required. The test was 
   first proposed by Durbin (1954) and separately by Wu (1973) (his T4 
   statistic) and Hausman (1978). This "Durbin-Wu-Hausman" (DWH) test is numerically 
   equivalent to the standard "Hausman test" obtained using {help hausman} with the 
   sigmamore option, in which both forms of the model must be estimated. Under the null, it is 
   distributed Chi-squared with m degrees of freedom, where m is the number of 
   regressors specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables regression.
   The ivendog output also contains another test statistic: the "Wu-Hausman"
   T2 statistic of Wu (1973). This routine is a replacement for "dmexog". W Its
   facilities are also available in our "ivreg2" routine via the "orthog" option.

Title: MRDUM: Stata module to create dummy variables and summary table for multiple response data
Author-Name: Lee E. Sieswerda 
Author-Email: Lee.Sieswerda@tbdhu.com
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Thunder Bay District Health Unit
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mrdum searches across varlist for integer codes
 and creates corresponding dummy variables. Each dummy is equal to 1
 if the integer code was found anywhere in varlist, 0 if not, and 
 missing if all of varlist is missing. It also displays a table 
 summarizing the results.
 This program was created specifically to deal with survey questions wherein 
 the respondent can give multiple responses to a single question (e.g. "Check 
 all that apply"). Sometimes these data are coded as a series of variables 
 with the responses entered in the order that the respondent indicated them. 
 Often, however, it is useful to have instead a set of dummy variables 
 that indicate whether the respondent indicated a particular response regardless
 of the order in which it was indicated.
Keywords: questionnaires, dummy variables, responses
Requires: Stata version 7.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install mrdum". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: MATRIXOF: Stata module to produce matrix or vector of results for paired or single variables
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: matrixof by default computes a matrix of results containing one result
 for a given command for each pair of variables in varlist. Alternatively, it
 computes a matrix of results containing one result for that command for each pair of
 variables containing one variable from each of two lists. vectorof computes a
 vector of results containing one result for a given for each variable in a list.
 In essence, the matrix or vector may be literally that, containing numeric values,
 or it may be a matrix or vector of graphs. Compare the established meaning of a
 scatter plot matrix. However, the graph matrix or vector will be wrapped around
 left to right and top to bottom.

Title: INTEXT: Stata module to read text files into string variables
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: The intext package inputs arbitrary text files into string variables 
 in the memory, without removing leading and trailing blanks (as infix does).
 intext contains 2 programs, intext and tfconcat. intext inputs a single text 
 file into a list of generated string variables, generating enough variables 
 to contain the longest input text line (including leading and trailing blanks).
 tfconcat concatenates a list of arbitrary text files into a new Stata data set 
 in memory, overwriting any previous data. The new data set contains a list of 
 string variables (as generated by intext), and also, optionally, additional 
 variables, indicating, for each observation, its input text file of origin and/or 
 its sequential order as a line within its input text file of origin. Therefore,
 tfconcat is like dsconcat, except that it concatenates text files instead of 
 Stata data sets. intext is an inverse of outfile,runtogether, because the 
 generated string variables created by intext can be output using 
 outfile,runtogether to produce a duplicate of the original file. Therefore,  
 intext enables Stata programs to read Stata programs, just as outfile,runtogether
  enables Stata programs to write Stata programs. 
Keywords: file handling, input, string variables

Title: IVHETTEST: Stata module to perform Pagan-Hall and related heteroskedasticity tests after IV 
Author-Name: Mark E Schaffer
Author-Email: m.e.schaffer@hw.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Heriot-Watt University
Author-Person: psc51
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: ivhettest performs various flavors of Pagan and Hall's (1983)
  tests of heteroskedasticity for instrumental variables (IV) estimation.
  It will also perform the related standard heteroskedasticity tests of
  Breusch-Pagan, Godfrey, Cook-Weisberg, White and Koenker
  after estimation by OLS or IV.
  These are tests of whether there is heteroskedasticity
  in the estimated regression that
  is related to one or more indicator variables.
  The test flavors vary
  according to the choice of indicator variables 
  and the choice of test statistics.
  Under the null of no heteroskedasticity,
  the test statistic is distributed as chi-sq with degrees of freedom =
  number of indicator variables.
  This is version 1.4 of ivhettest,
  updated from that published in Stata Journal, 3(1).
Keywords: instrumental variables, heteroskedasticity

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: gam fits a generalized or proportional hazards additive model (GAM) by
      mazimizing a penalized log likelihood function. Each component of the
      resulting estimated function of the covariates is a cubic smoothing
      spline. The smoothness of each component function is determined by the
      'equivalent degrees of freedom' of the corresponding covariate.
      Models supported:
      Normal (Gaussian) errors, binomial, Poisson, gamma, Cox (now with Stata's
      stcox), and link functions among identity, log, logit and inverse.
      This package is an update to accommodate the latest versions of the Windows
      operating system (specifically, Win 2000 and XP) and supersedes the version
      published in the STB (Royston P, Ambler G (1998) Generalized additive models.

 by Stata, and command that appear within foreach and forvalues loops.
 log2do2 uses the Stata 7 {help file} command to read and write the file.  This command
 was in an update to Stata; be sure your Stata is fully up to date.  The use
 of file allows log2do2 to preserve references to local macros in command lines.

Title: ALLPOSSIBLE: Stata module to fit all possible models with subsets of predictors
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: allpossible by default (1) computes all possible models fitted by
 a model command to a response and subsets of up to 6 predictors
 and (2) tabulates a list of statistics for each model fitted.
 Alternatively, (1') the maximum number of predictors fitted may
 be specified as a number less than 6. The model command must be a
 command fitting a model to a single response variable. 
 Naturally, this command does not purport to
 replace the detailed scrutiny of individual models or to offer an
 unproblematic way of finding "best" models. Its main use may lie
 in demonstrating that several models exist within many projects
 possessing roughly equal merit as measured by omnibus statistics.

Abstract: -explist- is a program to generate an exponentially-spaced list of numbers. 
 The syntax of explist is modelled on that of Nick Cox's listutil package, 
 which seems to offer all kinds of lists except exponentially-spaced ones. 
 The list can be stored in a macro variable and used as an -xlabel- or -ylabel- 
 list by the -graph- command when the -xlog- or -ylog- option is used. -explist- 
 takes, as input, a list of numbers x_1, ... , x_n, and creates, as output, a 
 list of numbers y_1, ... , y_n, derived exponentially from the input list, 
 so that, for each i,
 y_i = scale*base^x_i
 where base and scale are numbers given by options of the same names.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: fsum is a general purpose summary statistic program. Its display can be 
 formatted with appropriate labels and variable formats so that its output can be 
 pasted into a word processor without the need for further alterations within the 
 word processor. fsum provides summary statistics, including N, # missing, percent missing, 
 mean, variance, standard deviation, standard error, P1, P5, P25, median, P75, P95, P99, 
 minimum, maximum, confidence intervals, sum, and percent for 0/1 variables. It can 
 also display categories of a variable in a manner similar to tabulate. fsum allows 
 Stata labels and special user-defined labels.  Display width is automatically 
 adjusted for variable and label length. Column width is adjustable by format, 
 and variable labels are available optionally.
 nlabel provides a simple way to simultaneously create labels, nlabels, notes, etc.
Keywords: summarize, descriptive, mean, label

 within the panel.  The moving-window statistic is placed in a new variable,
 specified with the generate() option.  The statistics available include
 minimum, maximum, other key percentiles, mean and standard deviation:  one of
 these and/or other statistics returned by summarize, or easily computable
 from what it returns, may be specified.  aweights or fweights may be specified. Although
 mvsumm works with unbalanced panels (where the start and/or end points differ across units),
 it does not allow gaps within the observations of a time series; that
 is, the value of an observation for a given period may be missing, but the
 observation itself must be defined. Gaps in time series may be dealt with via
 the tsfill command. mvsumm7 may be used by Stata 7 users.
Keywords: descriptive statistics, moving window, time series, volatility
Requires: Stata version 8.0 (7.0 for mvsumm7)
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install mvsumm". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: REFORMAT: Stata module to reformat regression output
Author-Name: Tony Brady
Author-Email: tony@sealedenvelope.com
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Sealed Envelope Ltd.
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: The output from the last regression command is re-displayed in a more
 readable format using variable and value labels for clarity. The columns
 to be displayed can be controlled by the user
 and extra options to show the number of observations or likelihood ratio P-value
 associated with each
 covariate is provided. The command is particularly suited to regression
 output containing dummy variables and interaction terms created by xi.
 The reformatted output may also be copied into a spreadsheet or word-processor to create near-publication
 quality tables. The best way to do this is using the delimit(). Then
 copy and paste the output into a word processor and use a `convert
 text to table' option in your word processor.
 By default all terms fitted in the regression model are re-displayed,
 although this can be restricted by specifying varlist. Auxillary parameters,
 such as the second constant from nbreg or the cut points from ologit,
 are omitted.
Keywords: regression, output, format

Title: LEVELS: Stata module to report distinct levels of integer or string variable
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: levels displays a sorted list of the distinct values of varname,
 which should be a variable taking on integer or string values, or in
 other words, a categorical variable, very broadly so defined. It
 may be useful when it is desired to cycle through the
 distinct values of varname with (say) foreach. levels
 leaves behind a list in r(levels) which may be used in a
 subsequent command. Optionally, the list may be inserted
 as a local macro within the calling program's space.
 levels is considered to be vallist (STB-60) done better.
  levels requires Stata 8. 
 levels7, also herewith, is a version for Stata 7. 
Keywords: levels, vallist, Stata programming, values, foreach

Title: CIPOLATE: Stata module for cubic interpolation
Author-Name: Nicholas J. Cox
Author-Email: N.J.Cox@durham.ac.uk
Author-Person: pco34
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Durham
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: cipolate creates newvar = yvar where yvar is not missing and fills in newvar
 with cubicly
 interpolated values of yvar where yvar is missing. Interpolated values are
 based on exact fitting of a cubic curve to two data points before and two
 data points after each observation for which yvar is missing. cipolate will
 thus produce missing
 values whenever fewer than two data points are present on either side. Note
 that this is not a
 spline method. Extrapolation is not provided, mainly because of reservations
 about the general (and even
 particular) wisdom of extrapolating cubics into the unknown. Some users may
 wish to extrapolate any
 remaining missing values linearly using ipolate.
Keywords: cubic interpolation, Lagrange, ipolate, missing values

Title: VECECM: Stata module to estimate vector error correction models (ECMs)
Author-Name: Patrick Joly
Author-Email: pat.joly@utoronto.ca
Author-Workplace-Name: Industry Canada
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  vececm estimates a vector error correction model (ECM) after one
 or more cointegrating vectors have been identified using Johansen's
 maximum-likelihood cointegration rank test (see help  johans).
 vececm uses the estimates of the cointegrating vectors as
 calculated by johans (the beta' matrix) to compute the
 value of each vector.
 Each vector then appears in the system estimates constrained
 by the value of its corresponding weight (given by the alpha
 matrix) in each equation.
 vececm doesn't allow a varlist as it simply uses the one
 specified at johans. This package contains wntstmvq, omninorm, and johans,
 all of which are required by vececm.
Keywords: vector autoregression, vector error correction model, Johansen procedure

Title: VARLAG: Stata module to determine the appropriate lag length in VARs, ECMs
Author-Name: Patrick Joly
Author-Email: pat.joly@utoronto.ca
Author-Workplace-Name: Industry Canada
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  varlag reports various statistics that are meant to help select
 the proper lag structure to use in the estimation of Vector
 autoregressions (VARs) and Error Correction Models (ECMs).
 For each lag length, varlag
 reports the Multivariate portmanteau (Ljung-Box) statistic for white
 noise residuals, p-values from Omnibus tests of multivariate normality
 of the residuals, as well as the Breusch-Pagan statistic for the
 independence of residuals between equations.
 varlag also performs likelihood ratio tests to test successive
 null hypotheses of smaller lag length. This package contains bpagan,
 bgtest, vecar, and vececm, all of which are required by varlag.

Title: QHAPIPF: Stata module to perform Analysis of quantitative traits using regression and log-linear modelling when PHASE is unknown
Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command models the relationship between a normally distributed continuous
 variable in a population-based random sample and individuals' haplotype.
 This command uses an EM algorithm to resolve haplotype phase. Covariates 
 are constructed from the haplotype and used in a regression model. Additionally
 the EM algorithm also handles missing typings assuming MCAR.
Keywords: haplotype analysis, EM algorithm, phase
Requires: Stata version 7.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by

Author-WorkPlace-Name: Motu Economic and Public Policy Research
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: ivreg2 provides extensions to Stata's official ivreg and newey. ivreg2
 supports the same command syntax as official ivreg and supports
 (almost) all of its options. The main extensions:
 two-step feasible GMM estimation;
 continuously updated GMM estimation (CUE);
 LIML and k-class estimation;
 automatic output of the Hansen-Sargan or Anderson-Rubin statistic
 for overidentifying restrictions;
 C statistic test of exogeneity of subsets
 of instruments (orthog() option);
 kernel-based autocorrelation-consistent (AC)
 and heteroskedastic and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC)
 estimation, with user-specified choice of kernel;
 Cragg's "heteroskedastic OLS" (HOLS) estimator;
 default reporting of
 large-sample statistics (z and chi-squared rather than t and F);
 small option to report small-sample statistics;
 first-stage regression reported with F-test of excluded
 instruments and R-squared with included instruments
 "partialled-out";
 tests for weak instruments, redundancy of instruments, significance of endogenous regressors.
 ivreg2 can also be used for ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation
 using the same command syntax as Stata's official regress and newey.
 This is version 2.1.10 of ivreg2, updated from that published in Stata Journal, 4(2), requiring
 Stata 8.2 or better.
 Stata 7 users may use that version of ivreg2, accessible via net search ivreg2.
Keywords: instrumental variables, Sargan test, robust estimation, orthogonality, GMM, Hansen's J, heteroskedastic OLS,
 HAC, bandwidth, k-class estimator, LIML

Author-Name: Adrian Mander 
Author-Email: Adrian.Mander@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk
Author-Person: pma116
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This command allows the user to overlap the same graph BY a variable. 
 Hence it is possible to produce individual profiles simply including patient as the by 
 variable. You can overlay kernel densities, histograms and just about any graphing 
 function. However to get the best results the graph function needs to have an xlab() and ylab() 
 otherwise for the final plot there is no way of putting the same graphs on the same axes. 
 This is an enhanced version of the command published in STB-54 as gr43.

Title: DECOMP: Stata module to compute decompositions of earnings gaps
Author-Name: Ian Watson 
Author-Email:  i.watson@econ.usyd.edu.au
Author-Workplace-Name: ACIRRT, University of Sydney
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: decomp computes Blinder-Oaxaca wage decompositions. It compares the
 results from two regressions, using intermediate commands (himod and
 lomod), and produces a  table of output containing the decompositions.
 These decompositions show how much of  the wage gap is due to differing
 endowments between the two groups, and how much is due to discrimination
 (regarded as the portion of the wage gap due to the combined effect of 
 coefficients and slope intercepts for the two groups). decomp is designed for 
 Stata's regress command, but also
 works with other commands, such as ivreg, heckman and tobit. 
Keywords: wages, earnings, decomposition

Title: CLTEST: Stata modules for performing cluster-adjusted chi-square and t-tests
Author-Name: Jeph Herrin 
Author-Email: herrin@flyingbuttress.net
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: cltest is a pair of programs for analyzing data that have been randomized
 in clusters.  clttest compares the means of two sets of grouped outcomes,
 with optional support for group-stratified outcomes. clchi2 estimates an
 adjusted chi-square test of independence for 2xk groups, with optional
 support for group-stratified outcomes. Adjustments for clustering are taken
 from Donner & Klar (Cluster Randomization Trials in Health Services Research,
 2000), with the CLCHI2 program generalized to the 2xk case. chchi2 uses
 loneway to calculate the inter-cluster correlation,
 which in Stata 6.0 and higher includes a correction for imbalanced groups.

Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: avplot3 generates "partial regression plots" from an analysis of covariance
 model, where a category variable has been included in dummy-variable form among the regressors 
 along with a constant term (that is, a dummy for all but one categories appears) and that
 variable has been interacted with a continuous variable. The "partial predictions" of
 such a model are then defined, for each category, as the category-specific constant term
 plus the category-specific slope multiplied by the continuous variable. Any number of additional
 covariates, continuous or discrete, may appear in the regression model. Nick Cox' keyplot routine
 is included in the package, and utilized to generate the graphs.

Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: This package contains the programs multproc, smileplot and smileplot7.
       multproc inputs a data set with 1 observation for each of a set of multiple
       significance tests and data on the P-values, and carries out a multiple test
       procedure chosen by the user to define a corrected overall critical P-value
       for accepting or rejecting the null hypotheses tested. These procedures
       may be one-step, step-up or step-down, and may control the familywise error
       rate (eg the Bonferroni, Sidak, Holm, Holland-Copenhaver, Hochberg and Rom
       procedures) or the false discovery rate (eg the Simes, Benjamini-Liu,
       Benjamini-Yekutieli and Benjamini-Krieger-Yekutieli procedures). smileplot,
       and its Stata 7 version smileplot7, work by calling multproc and then
       creating a smile plot, with data points corresponding to multiple estimated
       parameters, the P-values (on a reverse log scale) on the Y-axis, and the
       corresponding parameter estimates (or another variable) on the X-axis. There
       are Y-axis reference lines at the uncorrected and corrected overall critical
       P-values. The reference line at the corrected critical P-value, known as the
       parapet line, is interpreted informally as a boundary between data mining and
       data dredging. multproc, smileplot and smileplot7 are used on data sets with
       one observation per estimated parameter and data on estimates and their
       P-values, which may be created using parmby, parmest, statsby or postfile.

Author-WorkPlace-Name: Universite de Paris-I
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: triprobit estimates simulated maximum-likelihood three-equation probit models using the GHK 
 smooth recursive simulator. The simulated maximum likelihood technique consists in 
 simulating the multivariate normal integrals which are involved 
 in the likelihhod equation. The simulated probabilities are fed 
 into the likelihood function which is then maximized using 
 traditional techniques. See Greene (2000, pp 184-185) for a 
 description of the simulation algorithm used here.

Author-Name: Paul Seed
Author-Email: paul.seed@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: King's College London 
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: Without the corr or spear options, ci2 and cii2 behave as ci and cii.
 With option corr, ci2 calculates the Pearson product moment correlation
 and produces a confidence interval, based on Fisher's transformation.  As with 
 correlate, ci2 takes frequency and analytic weights.
 With option spearman, (with or without corr), Spearman's rank correlation is used.
 cii2 is the immediate version.  There is no separate Spearman option, because 
 the method for finding the correlation is the same in both cases.
Keywords: correlations, confidence interval, Pearson, Spearman rank correlation

Title: MCL: Stata module to estimate multinomial conditional logit models
Author-Name: John Hendrickx
Author-Email: J.Hendrickx@yahoo.com
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Wageningen University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: MCL stands for Multinomial Conditional Logit, a term coined by Breen
 (1994). An MCL model uses a conditional logit program to estimate a
 multinomial logistic model. This produces the same log likelihood,
 estimates and standard errors, but allows greater flexibility in
 imposing constraints. The MCL approach makes it possible to impose
 different restrictions on the response variable for different
 independent variables. For example, linear logits could be imposed for
 certain independent variables and an unordered response for others. One
 specific application is to include models for the analysis of square
 tables, e.g. quasi-independence, uniform association, symmetric
 association, into a multinomial logistic model (Logan 1983, Breen 1994).
 Mclest can also estimate two types of models with both linear and
 multiplicative terms. The Stereotyped Ordered Regression model (SOR)
 estimates a metric for the dependent variable and a single parameter for
 each independent variable (Anderson 1984, DiPrete 1990). It is more
 flexible than ologit because it does not assume ordered categories,
 although it does assume that the response categories can be scaled on a
 single dimension. This makes it useful for "semi-ordered" variables such
 as occupation, where the rank of categories such as farmers is not
 altogether clear.
 A second special model that can be estimated by mclest is the Row and
 Columns model 2 (Goodman 1979). This model, originally developed for
 loglinear analysis, estimates a metric for a categorical independent
 variable as well as the response variable. The effect of the independent
 variable can therefore be expressed through a single parameter. The SOR
 and RC2 models are estimated by iteratively running MCL models, taking
 first one element of the multiplicative terms as given, then the other.

Title: DFAO: Stata module to perform Dickey-Fuller unit root test in the presence of additive outliers 
Author-Name: Richard Sperling
Author-Email: sperling.10@osu.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: The Ohio State University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: dfao is an extension of the dfuller routine in Stata. It performs the D-F unit root
 test when the data have additive outliers, or temporary one-time shocks. Such outliers
 give rise to moving average errors with negative coefficients and these in turn result
 in oversized unit root tests. The method employed here follows Vogelsang (1999).
 dfao also serves as a replacement for dfuller. Unlike the latter routine, DFAO
 conducts an automatic sequential t-test to determine the lag length to use in the DF

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: log2html makes use of an undocumented command in Stata version 7 up,
 log html, which generates HTML log files from SMCL log files.
 SMCL, the Stata Markup and Control Language, is the
 default log file format introduced with version 7, and contains
 markup (similar to HTML) around elements of the log file. To use
 log2html, you must first generate the default SMCL log file, not
 a text log file, with the file extension .smcl. log2html provides
 greater flexibility in formatting output than log html, and now provides preformatted
 schemes and support for CSS. 
 Stata 8 is required. (log2html7 is available for Stata 7.) 
Keywords: output, log
Requires: Stata version 8.0 (7.0 for log2html7)
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install log2html". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: DENTON: Stata module to interpolate a quarterly flow series from annual totals via proportional Denton method
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: denton computes the proportional Denton method of interpolation of an
 annual flow time series by use of an associated "indicator series", 
 imposing the constraints that the interpolated series obeys the annual 
 totals. The method is recommended in IMF publications as 
 "relatively simple, robust, and well-suited for large-scale applications."
 It may be particularly useful in cases where, due to sizable statistical
 discrepancy, quarterly series do not integrate to annual totals. The
 indicator series only contribute their pattern to the interpolation; 
 thus it is quite feasible to use both quarterly and annual flow series
 expressed at an annual rate. The interpolated series will be at a 
 quarterly rate. Although the procedure is usually applied to flow
 series (such as GDP), it may be applied to stock series if they are
 differenced and then integrated via generate..sum(), after adding their
 initial value. This version of the package also contains dentonmq, a routine
 to perform the same task for monthly interpolation of a quarterly series.
Keywords: benchmarking, time-series, interpolation

Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: powercal
 performs general power and sample size calculations, storing the result
 in a new variable. powercal can calculate any one of the number of
 sampling units, power, alpha (significance level), delta (difference
 in parameter value to be detected), or the standard deviation (SD) of
 the influence function. (The SD of the influence function is defined
 as the expected standard error of the sample difference multiplied by
 the number of sampling units.) Any of these 5 quantities can be
 calculated from the other 4. -powercal takes, as input, expressions
 delivering variables containing the 4 input quantities, and creates, as
 output, a variable containing the output quantity. These variables can
 then be plotted against each other, giving colleagues a view, at a
 glance, of the trade-offs involved.

Title: BKING: Stata module to implement Baxter-King filter for timeseries data
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: bking implements the band-pass filter proposed by Baxter and King
 (1995, NBER WP 5022) for the transformation of timeseries data to preserve
 business cycle frequencies. They demonstrate that it has desirable properties
 relative to frequency-domain methods such as band spectrum regression, and
 vis-a-vis the Hodrick-Prescott filter. 
Keywords: time-series data, filtering, busines cycles

Title: PARAN: Stata module to compute Horn's test of principal components/factors
Author-Name: Alexis Dinno
Author-Email: adinno@hsph.harvard.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Harvard School of Public Health
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: paran is an implementation of Horn's technique for evaluating the 
 components or factors retained in a principle components analysis (PCA) or a
 factor analysis. According to Horn, a common interpretation of non-correlated 
 data is that they are perfectly non-colinear, and one would expect therefore to 
 see eigenvalues equal to 1 in a PCA of such data. However, Horn notes that 
 multi-colinearity occurs due to sampling error and least-squares "bias," even 
 in uncorrelated data, and therefore actual PCAs of such data will reveal 
 eigenvalues of components greater than and less than 1. His strategy is to 
 contrast eigenvalues produced through a PCA on a random dataset (uncorrelated 
 variables) with the same number of variables and observations as the 
 experimental or observational dataset to produce eigenvalues for components or 
 factors that are adjusted for the sample error-induced inflation.

Author-Workplace-Name: Case Western Reserve University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: idonepsu identifies strata that have only one PSU and, optionally,
 merges them into the largest strata.  This command should be used 
 with caution as the appropriate merge of strata depends on the
 sample design.  This utility is intended for persons doing large
 secondary data analysis where they are uncertain of the sampling
 strategy and are, therefore, unable to identify the appropriate
 strata in which to merge.  The merge is done in accord with
 the method suggested by the Stata 7 manual.

 then be included in the stlog environment of SJ LaTeX. The program
 was derived by hybridising my own -dolog- with the SJ's logopen and
 logclose, which also create log files written in SJ LaTeX for
 inclusion in the stlog environment. dotex has the advantage that
 the same do-file can be run with dotex, dolog or do, creating,
 respectively, a SJ LaTeX log, a plain text log or no log.

Abstract: ipshin estimates the t-test for unit roots in heterogeneous panels developed by Im,
 Pesaran and Shin (IPS, 1997).  It allows for individual effects, time trends, and common time effects.
 Based on the mean of the individual Dickey-Fuller t-statistics  of each unit in the panel, the IPS test 
 assumes that all series are non-stationary under the null hypothesis. Lags of the dependent variable may be introduced to allow for serial correlation in 
 the errors.  The exact critical values of the t-bar statistic are given in IPS. After transformation by factors
 provided in the paper (available for no more than 8 lags on any series), the Psi[t-bar] statistic is distributed standard normal under the null
 hypothesis of nonstationarity.

Abstract: nharvey estimates one form of the test of common stochastic trends developed by 
 Nyblom and Harvey (NH, 2000). The test is of the validity of a specified value of the rank
 of the covariance matrix of the disturbances driving the multivariate random walk. This
 rank is equal to the number of common trends, or levels, in the series. As NH show, "this
 test is very simple insofar as it does not require any models to be estimated, even if
 serial correlation is present." (p.176) The special case calculated by nharvey
 is that of the rank (K in NH' terms) equalling zero, which may be taken as a test 
 that there are no common trends among the variables. NH state that "common trends imply
 cointegration, and vice versa." Thus a failure to reject the null hypothesis of zero
 common trends is also an indication that the variables do not form a cointegrated 
 combination. 
 The test may be considered as a generalization of the Nyblom and Makelainen (1983) and
 Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, kpss) univariate tests for stationarity of a series. 
 Those tests are of the null hypothesis that the series is stationary, or stationary
 around a deterministic trend, against the alternative that a random walk component
 is present. nharvey considers the same structure in the context of multiple
 time series.

Abstract: levinlin estimates the panel unit root test developed by Levin, Lin and Chu (2002). 
 The test assumes that each individual unit in the panel shares the same AR(1) coefficient,
 but allows for individual effects, time effects and possibly a time trend. Lags of the
 dependent variable may be introduced to allow for serial correlation in the errors. The test may
 be viewed as a pooled Dickey-Fuller test, or an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test when lags are
 included, with the null hypothesis that of nonstationarity (I(1) behavior). 
 After transformation, the t-star statistic is  
 distributed standard normal under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.

Title: HADRILM: Stata module to perform Hadri panel unit root test
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: hadrilm performs a test for stationarity in heterogeneous panel data
 (Hadri, 2000). This Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test has a null of stationarity,
 and its test statistic is distributed as standard normal under the null.
 The series may be stationary around a deterministic level, specific to the
 unit (i.e. a fixed effect) or around a unit-specific deterministic trend.
 The error process may be assumed to be homoskedastic across the panel,
 or heteroskedastic across units.  The residual-based test is based on the 
 squared partial sum process of residuals from a demeaning (detrending) model of 
 level (trend) stationarity. This is version 1.0.3 of the software.
Keywords: panel data, stationarity, unit roots

Title: FACTEXT: Stata module to extract factor values from a label variable created by parmest
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:       factext is used to extract factors (categorical variables) from a
      label variable in an output data set created by the parmest package.
      The parmest package creates a data set with 1 obs per estimated parameter
      and data on the parameter estimates, confidence limits, P-values, and
      (optionally) also a variable named label, containing the variable label for
      the X-variable corresponding to the parameter. If the X-variable is a dummy
      variable created by xi, tabulate or John Hendrickx's desmat package, then the
      value of label will be of the form "varname==value", where varname is a
      variable name and value is a numeric or string  value. factext uses this
      information to create new factors (categorical variables) with the specified
      varnames and values. These new variables can then be used to produce tables
      and/or plots. factext can be used together with the descsave package (q.v.)

Title: FACTREF: Stata module to insert new observations with reference values for factors

Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:         factref is used with factext, descsave, parmby and parmest (q.v.).  It takes, as
      input, a data set created by parmby or parmest, in which categorical
      variables (factors) have been created by descsave and factext. These factors
      are variables (numeric or string) representing categorical variables in the
      fitted model, represented by dummy variables such as those created by xi.
      factref adds to that data set a set of additional observations with reference
      values for these factors, copied from the omit characteristic for each
      factor. For each factor, factref creates one reference observation if there
      are non-missing values for the factor and there is no by-variable list, or
      one reference observation for each by-group where there are non-missing
      values of the factor if there is a by-variable list.  After the reference
      observations have been added, the user may create a plot or table of
      confidence intervals for factor effects.

Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:           factmerg inputs a list of factors and outputs up to 3 string variables,
      containing, in each observation, the name, variable label and value,
      respectively, of the first factor in the list with a nonmissing value in
      that observation. These string variables can be used in creating row labels
      for output tables and/or plots, possibly using the sencode package. The input
      factors are usually either created in a parmest or parmby output data set by
      using the factext package, or are in a data set created by concatenating
      multiple xcontract output data sets using dsconcat. The sencode, parmest,
      factext, xcontract and dsconcat packages are downloadable from SSC.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:       harmby ("harmonize within by-groups") checks that each variable in a
      varlist has no more than one value, other than the standard missing value,
      in each of the by-groups specified by by(), or in the whole data set, if
      by() is not specified. A standard missing value is . for a numeric
      variable, or the empty string "" for a string variable. If this condition
      is true, then harmby replaces all standard missing values in the by-group
      (or data set) by the one value that is not standard missing, if such a
      value exists, and takes no action if all values in a by-group (or data set)
      are standard missing.  harmby is useful if there are variables whose values
      should be unique within each by-group (or within the data set), and new
      observations with standard missing values for these variables have been
      added to some or all of the by-groups by merge, or by ingap, which is

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: metaninf investigates the influence of each individual study on
 the overall meta-analysis summary estimate. The command presents
 a table and a graph of the results of an influence analysis in
 which the meta-analysis is reestimated omitting each study in
 turn. metaninf is a parallel program to metainf (Aurelio  Tobias;
 STB-47: sbe26; STB-56: sbe26.1) that uses metan (rather than
 meta) as  its calculation engine, thus allowing access to the
 additional meta-analytic models offered therein.  metaninf also
 differs from metainf in that metaninf uses metan's syntax and a
 subset of its options (rather than those of meta). Program mhplot
 (a variation of Nicholas Cox's hplot) is a required support
 program.  This version (1.0.2) allows the jackknifed estimates to
 be saved.  A Stata 8 dialog is included.

Title: MADFULLER: Stata module to perform Dickey-Fuller test on panel data
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: madfuller performs the multivariate augmented Dickey-Fuller panel unit
 root test (Sarno and Taylor, 1998; Taylor and Sarno, 1998) on a variable 
 that contains both cross-section and time-series components. 
 The test applies Zellner's seemingly unrelated equation estimator (sureg)
 to N equations, defined for the N units of the panel. Each equation is
 specified as a k-th order autoregression. The test involves testing the
 hypothesis, for each equation, that the sum of the coefficients of the 
 autoregressive polynomial is unity. The null hypothesis consists of the 
 joint test that this condition is satisfied over the N equations. Under
 the null hypothesis, all of the series under consideration are realizations
 of I(1), or nonstationary, stochastic processes. 
Keywords: panel data, time series, unit root, Dickey-Fuller

Title: SPSURV: Stata module to fit split population survival ('cure') model
Author-Name: Stephen P. Jenkins
Author-Email: stephenj@essex.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: University of Essex
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: spsurv estimates what economists refer to as split population survival
 models (Schmidt and Witte, 1989) and biostatisticians refer to as cure
 models, for the case where survival times are intrinsically discrete or
 are recorded in grouped form, e.g. in months. (Cf. the continuous time
 lognormal cure model lncure.) Standard survival models assume that the
 prob(eventual failure) > 0 for all individuals. By contrast split
 population models suppose that a proportion never fail. spsurv
 estimates by ML this proportion together with the parameters
 characterising the hazard rate for the remainder of the population. For
 the latter, spsurv estimates a discrete-time proportional hazard
 (cloglog) model. It is a form of 'mover-stayer' model.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: svytabs generates a variety of tables using calls to Stata's svytab command.  
 Its advantages over svytab are in convenience and formatting.  A single 
 svytabs command can generate a table that would require many svytab commands 
 and tedious assembly of results.  By default, tables of percentages are 
 created in a comma delimited format that can be saved to a text file for 
 importing to other documents.  Statistically significant differences can 
 be flagged with asterisks.  Standard errors, confidence intervals, design 
 effects, and population counts can also be produced. Detailed output can 
 be logged while tables are saved in separate files.
Keywords: tables, survey data

Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: descsave is an
 extension of describe, creating up to 2 output data sets. These are a Stata data file
 with 1 observation per variable and data on the descriptive attributes of each variable
 (name, storage type, format value label, variable label, and characteristics if specified),
 and also a do-file, which can be called to reconstruct these descriptive attributes.
 The do-file created by descsave can be used if the data set has been saved using
 outsheet and input again using insheet. This can be useful if the user wishes to
 create a definitive generic spreadsheet version of the data, and to know that the original
 Stata version can be reconstructed from the definitive generic version. However,
 descsave can also be used when the user uses parmest,label after a regression command,
 using xi dummy variables for multilevel factors, and then reconstructs these multilevel
 factors from the variable label in the parmest output data set, in order to create
 tables and/or plots of confidence intervals.

Title: LQD: RATS module for regression via least quartile difference estimator
Author-Name: Eric Blankmeyer 
Author-Email: eb01@business.swt.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Southwest Texas State University 
Programming-Language: RATS
Abstract:  
 lqd.src computes a robust linear regression called
 the least quartile difference estimator (lqd). it was
 proposed in 
     Christophe Croux, Peter J. Rousseeuw, and Ola
     Hossjer (1994), "Generalized s-estimators,"
     Journal of the American Statistical Association,
     89, 1271-1281.
  The lqd is closely related to other high-breakdown,
  computer-intensive regression methods like least
  median of squares and least trimmed squares. All these
  methods are very effective at detecting outliers and
  leverage points in data. When the random errors are
  in fact uncontaminated Gaussian variables, lqd is more
  efficient than these other high-breakdown methods.
  (its asymptotic efficiency is about 67 percent
  compared to least squares at a Gaussian distribution;
  the asymptotic efficiency of lms is zero and that of
  lts is just 8 percent.) Moreover, the lqd regression 
  coefficients are asymptotically Gaussian with a covariance
  matrix proportional to the inverse of X'X.

Title: CF3: Stata module to compare two datasets
Author-Name: Thomas Steichen 
Author-Email: steichen@triad.rr.com
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: cf3 matches observations by a record id variable and lists the observations 
 where differences exist.  It compares variables of the dataset in memory (the 
 'master' data) to the corresponding variables in a file (the 'using' data).  
 Only the variable values are compared.  cf3 differs from cf in that: 1) the 
 id() option, which names the common record id variable in each file, is required;
 2) verbose is presumed but option noverbose will suppress some output; and 
 3) it will not stop if there is a differing number of observations in the two 
 files.  Generally, the id variable values should be unique within each file. 
 If the id values are not unique then proper matching may not occur; cf3 will 
 warn the user but will continue.  Incorrectly-matched observations, where the 
 variables being compared also differ, and unmatched observations will be 
 reported as differences.
Keywords: file comparison, matching ids, variable values
Requires: Stata version 6.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install  cf3". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: RGROUP: Stata module for Random Group Variance Estimation
Author-Name: Ulrich Kohler
Author-Email: ukohler@sowi.uni-mannheim.de
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Universitat Mannheim
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: rgroup calculates the random group variance estimator described by
 Wolter (1985). This estimator is an alternative to other estimators of
 the variance of sample statistics for survey data e.g. the jackknife
 or taylor linearization. The application of the random group estimator
 requires, that random groups are already defined during data
 collection. This for example is the case in the GSOEP, the German
 Socio-economic Panel.
Keywords: survey data, random group, variance 
Requires: Stata version 6.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing

Title: SDECODE: Stata module to decode a numeric variable into a string variable
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  sdecode (super decode) creates an output string variable with values from
 the input numeric variable varname, using labels if present and formats otherwise.
 The output string variable may either replace the input numeric variable or be generated
 as a new variable named newvar. Unlike decode, sdecode creates an output string
 variable containing the values of the input variable as output by the list command
 and other Stata output, instead of decoding all unlabelled input values to missing.
 sdecode is especially useful if a numeric variable has value labels for some values
 but not for others.
Keywords: data manipulation

 "ssc install sdecode". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: SENCODE: Stata module to encode a string variable non-alphanumerically into a numeric variable
Author-Name: Roger Newson
Author-Email: roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine
Author-Person: pne37
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  sencode is a sequential version of encode. It takes, as input, a string
      variable, and generates, as output, a numeric variable, with value labels
      corresponding to values of the string variable. Unlike encode, sencode
      orders the numeric values corresponding to string values in the sequential
      order of appearance in the input string variable in the data set, or in
      another order specified by the user, instead of ordering them in alphanumeric
      order of the string value, as encode does. The mapping from numeric code
      values to string labels may be one-to-one (coded in order of first
      appearance of the string value) or many-to-one (coded in each observation
      by the position of that observation in the data set, or in the user-specified
      ordering).

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: Given a variable varname, call it x with c.d.f. F(x), 
 glcurve7  draws its Generalised Lorenz curve and/or generates two
 new variables containing the Generalised Lorenz ordinates for x, i.e.
 GL(p) at each p = F(x).
 For a population ordered in ascending order of x, a graph of GL(p) against
 p plots the cumulative total of x divided by population size, against
 cumulative population share. GL(1) = mean(x).  glcurve7  can also be used
 to derive many other related concepts such as Lorenz curves, concentration
 curves and 'Three Is of Poverty' (TIP) curves, with appropriate definition of
 varname, order of cumulation (set with the  sortvar option), and
 normalisation (e.g. by the mean of  varname). Alternatively  glcurve7
 with the  lorenz,  atip or rtip option can be used directly
 to draw the related Lorenz, concentration and TIP curves. 
 glcurve7 is an update of glcurve that appeared in the STB
      as sg107 (STB-49 and STB-48).
Keywords: inequality, Lorenz curve, graphics

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: strdate replaces a list of string date variables with a list of Stata numeric date variables having the same names, the same positions in the data set
 order, and the same variable labels (if present). The conversion is carried out using the Stata date() function. strdate is used when the user has input
 a generic ASCII data file produced by a spreadsheet, using the infile command, and the data file includes character-format date variables. The infile
 command converts these to string variables. The strdate command converts these to numeric date variables with the same names, dropping the old string
 variables. This saves the user the trouble of converting the variables one by one, inventing new names, and worrying about the order of variables in the
 data. The program strdate is written in Stata Version 7.

Abstract: xdatelist creates a numeric list of dates bounded by a string-format  
 first and last date and spaced by a given number of time units (eg weeks, months,
 quarters or years). It is similar to the numlist command, and returns the numeric 
 dates in the result r(numlist). Optionally, datelist also
 returns a list of formatted string dates in the result r(strlist). 
 The program is useful if the list of dates is separated by unequal numbers of days
 (because months and years vary in length). The program is written in Stata Version 7 and was
 previously circulated as datelist, a name that has been taken over by StataCorp.
Keywords: data manipulation
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install xdatelist". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: VECAR: Stata module to estimate vector autoregressive (VAR) models
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract:  vecar estimates vector autoregression (VAR) models. Each of the variables 
 in depvarlist is regressed on maxlag lags of depvarlist, a constant
 (unless suppressed) and the exogenous variables provided in varlist (if any). 
 varlist may contain time-series operators.
 A set of "block F" tests evaluates the joint significance of each variable's 
 lagged values in each equation. The log determinant of the residual covariance  matrix is 
 calculated, most commonly to test the appropriateness of a model
 with a smaller maxlag. A portmanteau test for white noise errors,  a test
 for cross-equation independence of errors and a multivariate normality test are available.
 This is version 1.1.14 of the software.
 Version 6 users should use vecar6 (q.v.)
Keywords: vector autoregression, VAR, timeseries
Requires: Stata version 7.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by 
 typing "ssc install  vecar". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: MKTAB: Stata module to print table of estimates in delimited or screen-presentation format
Author-Name: Nick Winter
Author-Email: nw53@cornell.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Cornell University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: mktab estimates one or more single-equation models, and 
 prints the results in tab- (or other) delimited format for importation into a 
 spreadsheet or word-processor. This facilitates creating tables in 
 "journal-article" format, i.e. with standard errors in parentheses below
 parameter estimates, significance flagged, and so on.
 mktab estimates each model specified. It then produces a delimited 
 table with the dependent variables across the top, the RHS variables (and 
 auxiliary parameter and returned estimates results) down the left, and 
 the coefficients and standard errors in the cells. Each column corresponds 
 to a single model; each row to a single RHS variable.
 mktab} is similar to John Gallup's exemplary {help outreg}. The primary differences
 are that it estimates all the models and generates the table with a single command,
 and that it does not require preserving and restoring the data. In addition, it
 has an option to display output in space-delimited columns on the screen. This is version 3.1.10 of
 the software.
Keywords: tabular output, presentation, estimation
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install mktab". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

 current directory, so remember the location for further 
 reference, as you might need to type in the full path then.
 Otherwise, just type tutorial aboutreg to get started.
 All standard Stata tutorials come in the core Stata directory,
 so to be able to launch this aboutreg thing, you can copy
 it there (only if you fully understand what you are doing, though).

Abstract: hegy4 performs the Hylleberg et al. (HEGY) test for seasonal unit 
 roots in a quarterly timeseries. It estimates the four roots of the timeseries
 representation (1-B^4) x(t) = e(t), where B is the backshift operator, and 
 presents estimates of these roots as Pi(1)..Pi(4). Joint tests for 
 Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0, Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0 and
 Pi(1)=Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0 are calculated (the latter two proposed by Ghysels
 et al.) The routine will also estimate the model with seasonal trends proposed by Smith
 and Taylor. This is version 1.0.5 of the routine, which corrects an error
 in the tabulation of critical values.

Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: grnote adds text and lines for annotating a Stata graph just drawn.  
 Text is positioned by the options y(#) and x(#) where values are 
 given in the scale of the data.  A line extending from the text 
 can be drawn by specifying its end point using the y2(#) and x2(#) 
 options.  An arrow can be added to the end of the line using the arrow
 option.  Other options are available for fine-tuning the placement, 
 size and pen # of the added elements.  Options are also available for 
 accumulating multiple annotations on the same graph and for saving the 
 resulting graph. The grnotem command allows grnote's features to be accessed  
 via a dialog box within interactive Stata. To some degree grnote substitutes 
 for Stage, which is no longer available under Stata Version 7. This is version  
 2.6 of the software.

Abstract: This GAUSS package can be used for specifying, estimating and evaluating 
 Smooth Transition Autoregressive - Smooth Transition GARCH models. The user can 
 test linearity against STAR, specify and estimate a STAR model for the conditional 
 mean, test the null of no ARCH, and, if rejected, estimate a GARCH model. After that, 
 the user can carry out misspecification tests for the estimated GARCH model and, if 
 the results suggest such a step, estimate a STGARCH model for the conditional variance.

Title: IVPROB-IVTOBIT6: Stata modules to estimate instrumental variables probit and tobit
Author-Name: Joseph Harkness 
Author-Email: joe.harkness@jhu.edu
Author-Workplace-Name: Institute for Policy Studies, The Johns Hopkins University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: These programs implement Amemiya Generalized Least Squares (AGLS) estimators for probit
 and tobit with endogenous regressors.  Newey (J.Metr. 1987, eq. 5.6) provides the formulas 
 used.  The endogenous regressors are treated as linear functions of the instruments
 and the other exogenous variables. ivprob and ivtobit are used for estimating probit models where one or more 
 of the independent variables is endogenous.  Neither weights nor the robust
 option are implemented.
 divprob produces marginal effects for ivprob. The ivtobit6 routine was previously named
 ivtobit, but renamed to avoid confusion with Stata 8.2's ivtobit command. Stata 8.2 or 9.x users
 should use official ivprobit and ivtobit.
Keywords: probit, tobit, instrumental variables
Requires: Stata version 6.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install  ivprob-ivtobit6". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: TRINARY: Stata module containing extensions to generate to implement three-way logic
Author-Name: David Kantor
Author-Email: dkantor@jhu.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Institute for Policy Studies, Johns Hopkins University
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: There are logical expressions where
 some of the operands may be missing, but the result ought to be a definite
 non-missing value.  The desirable situation would be to obtain the maximal
 set of nonmissing results for all combinations of operand values.
 This is three-valued logic. These extensions to generate provide functions that
 implement AND and OR both row-wise and column-wise, as well as NOT, in a three-valued
 (trinary) context. 
Keywords: extensions to generate, three-valued logic, trinary logic
Series: Statistical Software Components
Requires: Stata version 6.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install  trinary". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.

Title: XTTEST2: Stata module to perform Breusch-Pagan LM test for cross-sectional correlation in fixed effects model
Author-Name: Christopher F Baum
Author-Email: baum@bc.edu
Author-WorkPlace-Name: Boston College
Author-Person: pba1
Programming-Language: Stata
Abstract: xttest2 calculates the Breusch-Pagan statistic for cross-sectional 
 independence in the residuals of a fixed effect regression model or a GLS 
 model estimated from cross-section time-series data. 
 xtreg, fe estimates this model assuming independence 
 of the errors. A likely deviation from independent errors in the context of 
 pooled cross-section time-series data (or panel data) is likely to be 
 contemporaneous correlations across cross-sectional units. These correlations 
 are those exploited by Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) 
 estimator, and this test is provided by sureg, corr in that context. 
 This version of the routine is updated from that published in SJ 1-1 to
 properly handle unbalanced panels, and will work after ivreg2 on panel data.
Keywords: contemporaneous correlation, panel data, cross-section time-series

Requires: Stata version 6.0
Note: This module may be installed from within Stata by typing 
 "ssc install xttest2". Windows users should not attempt to download these files with a web browser.
